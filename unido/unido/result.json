The MFP is a national / subregional programme based in Senegal. It aims to bring energy to the poorest rural areas and thus contributes to poverty alleviation and increasing the quality of life. A village enterprise - the Multifunctional-Platform: more time and more income for rural women and higher levels of schooling for girls Using a simple diesel engine, rural people, particularly women, can now have access to affordable, simple and modern energy services. This improved access saves time and effort that can be devoted to income-generating activities, education, health and childcare. Such platforms, created on a demonstration basis, were originally implemented in the 1990s in Senegal, Mali and Burkina Faso with the support of UNIDO. Between 2002 and 2005, UNIDO implemented a UNDP project The Multi-Functional Platform, MFP, for Poverty Alleviation. Within the pilot phase of the project in Senegal, UNIDO installed 40 Multi-Functional Platforms and trained more than 200 people in promoting their productive use. It has also ensured regular technical and management monitoring of the project. The platforms, mainly owned and managed by women, have provided an appropriate solution to energy constraints in rural areas. UNIDO greatly appreciates the breakthrough in funding and up-scaling of this new programme. The new programme aims to install some 500 platforms, for around 500,000 rural beneficiaries. UNIDO has been invited to participate in the formulation of a new project called Empowering rural communities to realize a minimum standard of living, with focus on reproductive health, together with the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP). Along with UNDP, and with the support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, UNIDO proposes to provide assistance in the redesign of the platform, using renewable energies. This would, at the same time, promote the role of the private sector in Senegal. UNIDO, as a technical partner, would be responsible for the manufacturing and technical components of the projects for promoting local manufacturing capacities needed for food production and other sectors such as medicinal plants and cosmetics. UNIDO is prepared to offer its expertise to further develop and implement this valuable project. \n", "issueTime": "28 March 2008"},

A pdf version of the press release is available here. The Government of Japan has contributed 5 million US Dollars to UNIDO for a multi-stakeholder Programme to be implemented under the banner Productive and Decent Work for Youth in the Mano River Union (MRU) countries (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) and Côte d’Ivoire. The international community pays a great deal of attention to ensuring peace and stability in West Africa. The general strike in Guinea in January 2007 and the resulting casualties prompted the proclamation of martial law. UN Peacekeeping missions have been deployed in Côte d’Ivoire and Liberia. The UN Peacebuilding Commission, of which Japan has been Chair since June 2007, selected Sierra Leone as a target country and identified youth employment as a priority area for peace-building in the country. The MRU countries and Côte d’Ivoire are examples of the dangers of high youth unemployment and how severely this can affect sub-regional security. This region is undermined by youth unemployment, with one survey suggesting that youth unemployment rates run as high as 88% in Liberia and 60-70% in Sierra Leone, a factor that is only further compounded by the difficulties faced in obtaining accurate and up-to-date census data. The multi-agency programme aims to create employment opportunities for youth in the MRU countries and Côte d’Ivoire, and to contribute to social and political stability, and economic growth in the region. TICAD IV GRAPHIC Towards a Vibrant Africa: A Continent of Hope and Opportunity 28–30 May 2008 The programme directly addresses the needs of youth by linking opportunities in transnational corporations and private companies. It assists and trains youth in identifying, designing, and implementing projects in self-employment and group activities, establishes a financing facility for youth-led projects in partnership with local banks and financial institutions, and trains youth in various skills such as mining, forestry, agriculture, agro-industries, and construction. The programme will also set up a sub-regional information system on supply and demand of the labour market, as well as a programme management system, which includes monitoring, learning lessons, public relations and an Information, Communication and Technology network. The Government of Japan has welcomed this programme as one of the forms of UNIDO cooperation built into the framework of the Fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD IV), to be held in Yokohama, Japan, from 28–30 May 2008, under the theme Towards a Vibrant Africa: A Continent of Hope and Opportunity. UNIDO has expressed its full commitment to the success of the conference. UNIDO Director-General, Dr. Kandeh Yumkella, indicated the tremendous importance of cooperation between UNIDO and Japan on his first visit to the country in March 2006, followed by his second visit in October 2007. He is expected to participate actively in the conference. Many African countries have been experiencing relatively high economic growth rates. Taking advantage of the tide of economic growth, the Government of Japan hopes that UNIDO, through this programme, will contribute to giving hope and opportunity to the youth in MRU countries and Côte d’Ivoire. \n", "issueTime": "19 March 2008"},

The findings from two international conferences on African industrial performance and opportunities are featured in this number, while the personal perspectives column offers an approach to putting the least developed countries (LDCs) on the fast track to economic prosperity. \nGoing from strength to strength as an internationally recognized benchmark for comparative economics since its launch four years ago, UNIDO’s 2007 Industrial Development Scoreboard ranks 100 countries according to competitive industrial performance. The blending of industrial development indicators with manufacturing value added, manufacturing exports per capita, industrialization intensity and export quality makes it a unique tool for measuring economic performance in both developed and developing countries. \nEmanating from a meeting of internationally renowned economists in Tokyo, the experiences of Africa and Asia provide economic insights by comparing productivity and growth in the two continents. A candid assessment emerges of policy options in the crucial areas of foreign direct investment and technology diffusion. \nIn honour of the late Indian economist Sanjay Lall, an international conference in New Delhi offers the latest thinking on the potential for cooperation between India and Africa in industry, trade and investment. As well as looking at cooperation from a macroeconomic perspective, opportunities are identified in six specific sectors of industrial activity crucial for African development. \nWith an 80-year gap in manufacturing value added between the world’s poorest nations and other developing countries, UNIDO statistician Shyam Upadhyaya tackles the issue of identifying a viable solution for bridging the divide. Drawing on statistical analysis from the Research and Statistics Branch, he suggests an approach for LDCs to catch up with the rest of the Third World in 25 years and with industrialized nations in 50 years. \nMr. Yoshiteru Uramoto, Deputy to the Director-General, Managing Director Programme Coordination and Field Operations division Please see Research Update No.4 for further information. \n", "issueTime": "7 March 2008"},

The Summit brought together leading branding experts and government representatives, and showcased success stories of Branding for Sustainability – a theme that raises awareness of brands’ impact on business performance, upgrading and sustainable development. \nThe event was held in an online and offline hybrid format, gathering hundreds of participants from government, business, academia and international organizations. Discussions highlighted the ever-growing importance of branding and intellectual property, particularly in times of COVID-19 and increased digitalization. \n“The pandemic has brought inevitable challenges, but also opportunities. As we have seen during this pandemic, digitalization has accelerated dramatically. It has opened a window of opportunity for new approaches, including in branding,” noted LI Yong, Director General of UNIDO. \nGerhard Hrebicek, President of the EBI, underlined the fact that “brands are the most valuable intangible assets that, unfortunately, remain the least understood”. \nUNIDO has pioneered branding as a tool for sustainable and inclusive industrial development. Since launching the service module, “Branding for competitiveness and sustainable growth (B4C)”, the approach has generated a number of success stories across the globe and industries. Examples of corporate - , destination -, city- and region- branding initiatives showd the value of (umbrella) branding initiatives for improving product quality, leading to more competitiveness, sales and contributing to sustainable development. \nInvestment in brands show superior returns and short payback times, as UNIDO’s project beneficiaries showcased. UNIDO’s branding initiatives have had a large impact on Armenia’s textile sector, Cuba’s agribusiness development, Namibia’s sustainable bush harvesting, Morocco and Tunisia’s food-processing, and Tajikistan’s carpet industries, leading to an increase in tax income, exports and job creation. \nRepresentatives from the private sector also emphasized the value of brands and highlighted the need for a uniform approach to brand evaluation. Only 10% of companies make use of brands, so “branding has to be democratized, proactively managed and measured, thereby resulting in increased competitiveness, innovation and sustainable development, contributing to the SDGs,” Hrebicek added. \nSpeakers identified financing for companies through brands and the potential and challenges of digitalization for brands as among the main challenges. It is easier than ever to become global, by going online, but that requires integrated planning and a strategic branding and digitalization initiative, suggested Austria's Federal Minister of Digital and Economic Affairs, Margarete Schramböck, who underlined that “branding for digitalization is key, and comes first in all the initiatives.” \nHhighlighting the benefits, UNIDO's Li noted: “As digitalization continues to accelerate dramatically during the pandemic, UNIDO incorporates the perspective of developing countries that turn towards innovation-intensive production and intelligent marketing, including strategic branding as a tool to advance inclusive and sustainable industrial development”. \nTo address the challenges going forward, UNIDO and the EBI will further expand their branding activities globally. Raising awareness of the value of brands and realize their potential for sustainability will require the combined efforts of this partnership, the private sector’s awareness and public support. Bringing the discussion to the highest levels and decision-makers, branding can guide companies on innovative paths to increase their value added and achieve sustainability. Therefore, UNIDO and EBI are planning a Brand Global Summit roadshow, with worldwide coverage, to address the bottlenecks of branding and increase strategic brand management’s efficacy for sustainable development. \nFor more information on the Brand Global Summit 2020, click here . \nTo view the Brand Global Summit broadcasted on YouTube, click here . \nFor more information on the joint UNIDO-EBI initiative, click here . \nFor further information, contact: \nFarrukh Alimdjanov, Industrial Development Officer, UNIDO Department of Digitalization, Technology and Innovation \nEmail \n", "issueTime": "1 October 2020"},

Representatives of the two companies received their certificates from the Head of UNIDO's Regional office in China, Sajjad Ajmal, at the UNIDO regional office in Beijing. The Ozone Secretariat nominated over 70 projects, covering various sectors. The two Chinese refrigeration companies (submitted by UNIDO) were among 31 projects selected from the 70 nominees. Congratulating the winners, Mr. Ajmal said \"The Montreal Protocol has been recognized as the most successful international treaty to date and conveys a message of hope for solving other environmental threats\". During the presentation ceremony, Deputy Director General, Foreign Economic Cooperation Officeof the State Environmental Protection Administration ( SEPA ), Mr. WEN Wurui, said \"These two projects are examples and models for the excellent cooperation between international communities, Chinese Government, industry association and enterprises. The key factors to the success of these two projects are: enterprise's high social responsibility and strong sense of environment protection, CHEAA’s (China Household Electrical Appliances Association) guidance and support, and the mutual efforts given by international community, the latter, in this case, represented by UNIDO\". In his summing up, Mr. WEN said that the success of the projects \"not only lies in environment protection. The more important is the win-win of environment of protection and economy development. The projects could be used to demonstration how environmental protection can accelerate economic development\". Ms. JIANG Feng, Secretary General of CHEAA, was also present at the ceremony and pointed out that the two companies had invested considerable money, manpower and material resources, to ensure the projects were implemented smoothly and successfully. She said that the success of these two projects played a very active role to boost the upgrading in the refrigerator sector, accelerating the phase out of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) in all sectors in China by three years. \"The award certificates were designed and issued by the Ozone Secretariat of the Montreal Protocol to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Montreal Protocol , in recognition of the work carried out by Governments, enterprises and implementing agencies\", Mr. Ajmal told reporters. He said that to date, more than 5,000 projects for phasing out Ozone Depleting Substances ( ODS ) have been implemented worldwide with the support of Montreal Protocol funds. The compressor conversion from CFC-12 to R600a by Jiaxipera Compressor Co. Ltd. is a first for China. The conversion of the production line commenced in 1996 and was completed in August 1997. In addition to the benefits to the environment through the project, the production capacity of Jiaxipera Compressor has improved dramatically. Proudly accepting his award, General Manager of Jiaxipera, Mr. ZHU Jinjiao said \"The project brought a valuable philosophy to Jiaxipera on enterprise development:digest, import and absorb. Before the project, we doubted the competence of our enterprise to walk in the way of technology innovation. The project increased our abilities and confidence, and the new management capacity has made an enormous contribution to the company's success in the national as well in the international market. Production output has increased from one to eight million compressors per year and the COP (a ratio of the cooling capacity and power input) has increased from 0.95 to 1.8. ... Twenty million new compressor units, with higher energy efficiency without consuming CFCs were produced after the completion of the project. If all these compressors are in use for 15 years, 66.8 trillion kWh would be saved, which means the reduction of 44 million tons CO2\". At the Montreal Protocol Award ceremony in the UNIDO Office Beijing: Ms. WANG Lei, Deputy Secretary General, China Household Electrical Appliance Association (CHEAA); Ms. YANG Xiaohua, National Programme Officer, UNIDO Beijing Office; Mr. WEN Wurui, Deputy Director General, FECO of SEPA; Representative of Award winner Hangzhou Huari Refrigerator Co.

Minister Srithirath was in Vienna for the 51st Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) held from 10 to 14 March. Lao PDR was once the third largest producer of illicit opium in the world. Ten years after the 1998 United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) resolution, the country has reduced opium poppy cultivation and production by over 94%. That is not to say the problem is solved. The isolated ethnic groups that grew the poppies are poor and need an attractive and sustainable alternative to their opium income. The current three-year joint UNODC-UNIDO programme began in December 2006, in the Hoon, La and Xai districts of Oudomxay, Laos, with US$2 million funding provided by the Japan-funded UN Trust Fund for Human Security (UNTFHS). In its first year the project focused on: rehabilitating opium addicts and involving them in income generating activities; establishing a productivity and marketing center; strengthening and training village productivity groups to contribute to rural economies; and organizing communities to manage the social development of their villages. Current activities focus on: enhancing the coverage and operation of the social services; and improving or constructing basic infrastructure. The third and final year of the project will: improve market access of products; and ensure that the income generation activities are sustainable. The partners would like to extend the programme to cover the 1,100 villages in 32 of the poorest districts identified for priority assistance by the Lao National Poverty Reduction Programme. The current budget estimate for such a programme is in the vicinity of $US 40 million. In their efforts to mobilize these funds the partners will be drawing the attention of potential donors to the impact the programme is already having in its geographical focus area. A very positive acknowledgement of that impact by the Mini Dublin Group for Lao, which visited the project in February this year should help drum up donor interest. The Mini Dublin Group was invited to get a first hand impression of what this pilot project does linking the expertise of two UN agencies. Minister Srithirath together with project staff and representatives of UNIDO, UNODC and the UN Development Programme (UNDP) accompanied the Group. As UNIDO Representative and Head of UNIDO's Regional Office in Bangkok, Ayumi Fujino, who was with the group said \"The Mini Dublin Group was very impressed with progress, they saw for themselves how \"appropriate production technology\" was providing a sustainable alternative to opium production and improving livelihoods\". In addition to supporting funds mobilization efforts in general, the Group's positive impression of the joint UNODC-UNIDO programme may encourage member countries of the Mini-Dublin to support the expansion of the programme and to support the idea of further UNODC partnerships, both with UNIDO and other UN Organizations.

He noted the need to improve skills, and the certification of products and services, and to increase transparency. “MSMEs are the key drivers of regional economic growth but the lockdown measures put in place in every country have impacted their ability to produce, trade and serve their communities as supply chains were disrupted,” lamented Kachka. \nNaira Margaryan, Armenia’s Deputy Minister of Economy, noted the imperative of building capacity for women and youth, given the paucity of leadership positions they occupy. She said, “Although the crisis has been devastating for some, for other businesses it creates new employment and self-employment opportunities. In Armenia, we are seeing women embrace this as an opportunity to step up, so, to support their efforts, we in the government are working to provide better access for women to enter business networks and are supporting capacity and skill-building, particularly in the manufacturing sector.” \nMilena Angelova, Vice-President of the EU’s European Economic and Social Committee , focused on the need for targeted investments to specific sectors, for digitalization of MSMEs, digital skills and financial support to MSMEs, particularly through enhanced partnerships. “The main challenge is to prevent any loss of industrial production but to do this, we need to map out the impact of the pandemic on individual sectors and countries to identify where support is needed the most. Until now, much of the business community’s response to the crisis has been on a local level. This approach will not deliver a sustainable recovery. To do so, we need to draw these efforts together, to form a network across Europe and Asia to build cohesion and a multiplier effect,” said Angelova. \nMaja Tomanic-Vidovic, Director, Slovene Enterprise Fund , noted that since the outbreak of COVID-19, 75 per cent of MSMEs had lost employees, 70 per cent had falling revenues, while 40 per cent suffer from liquidity issues. In the long-run, she noted, MSEMs will have to adapt to the accelerated paradigm of digitalization. She warned, “We have to accept that nothing will be the same as before…companies that don’t accept this will have problems in the future.\" Concluding, Jacek Cukrowski, Chief of UNIDO’s Regional Programme, Europe and Central Asia, noted that the MSME sector is the backbone of any national economy, and that innovation is “at the core of modern business”. He listed UNIDO’s interventions in this area, including tailored programmes for the digitalization of MSMEs, enhancing digital resilience and competitiveness, digital upskilling and training. Cukrowski stressed, “Ensuring [MSMEs’] resilience is key to creating a more inclusive and resilient, human-centered future and a thriving global economy.” \nTo see this session and the others in the GMIS Digital Series, click here .

According to the organizers’ official communication, the awards identify those who exemplify the very best in their fields, and recognize the important work that is being done by individuals, organizations, agencies and corporations. \nThe AEE International Project of the Year Award was accepted by national project manager, Alf Hartzenburg of the NCPC-SA, at the AEE International Virtual Awards ceremony. AEE members and executives from around the world responded with enthusiastic accolades when the summary of the IEE project achievements was read out by the chairperson of the awards committee. \nThe IEE project, currently its second phase, funded by the Global Environment Facility, is set to run until December 2021. Other second phase project partners include South Africa’s Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, which funds the NCPC-SA, the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources, and its agency, the South African National Energy Development Institute (SANEDI). \nAccording to Hartzenburg, what sets this project apart is that it partners with and equips industry to tackle practical energy management in companies of all sizes. \nHe said, “Through expert-level training of industry professionals, demonstration of actual impact and methodologies aligned to international standard ISO 50001, the project partners have ensured that both the skills and the appetite exist to implement energy management.” \nHartzenburg continued, “The benefits are made clear in the energy savings, which result in direct financial savings on utilities and other energy sources, and we don’t leave the companies to go it alone, but support them with skills and financial linkages, where possible.” \nHartzenburg believes that the return to post-lockdown operations offers companies an ideal opportunity to consider changes that will ultimately save them operating costs, thus aiding in the recovery process and long-term sustainability. \n“SANS/ISO 50001, the energy management best practice standard, actually saves companies money. We are offering companies technical support to comply with this standard, and even some financial support if they want to apply for certification through the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS).” \nHartzenburg said his team is particularly proud of the huge environmental impact of the project. “Energy savings, particularly in a fossil-fuel based economy such as South Africa, have a direct climate mitigation benefit - which is why the GEF has funded our second phase.” \nBased on internationally accepted calculations, the NCPC-SA reports that energy saved by companies through the IEE project has mitigated 6.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) since April 2011 when the first savings were measured. \nSANEDI is working with the information gathered through the NCPC-SA interventions, and is using them together with relevant international and national energy trends to inform national energy and policy planning, including the adaptation of the National Energy Efficiency Strategy. \nRana Ghoneim, head of UNIDO’s Energy Systems and Infrastructure Division, said the award was an excellent recognition of the strong ownership, committed leadership and multi-stakeholder partnership that is driving industrial energy efficiency in South Africa. “The programme has always been a great example, inspiring other countries within the UNIDO global programme, where its impacts transcend beyond South Africa.” \nThe IEE project has a strong focus on gender mainstreaming and promoting the participation of women in energy. To date, 43% of the professionals trained through the project are female. \nThe project also includes awareness-raising in its activities, as evidence strongly supports the idea that sustained energy savings are brought about through behaviour change. This active communication approach made the project an even stronger candidate for the AEE International Award which encourages projects with “significant success in savings and/or visibility”. \nSee a fact sheet on the South Africa Industrial Energy Efficiency Project here . \nFor more information, contact: \nJulie Wells,Communication Manager, NCPC-SA \nCell: +27 (0)74899 9819 \nEmail: jwells@csir.co.za \nPetro de Wet, UNIDO South Africa \nCell: +27 (0)60679 1359 \nEmail: p.dewet@unido.org \n", "issueTime": "15 October 2020"},

The meeting was complemented with a presentation by Wim Naudé, Professor at Maastricht School of Management, as well as Fellow at the African Studies Centre at the University of Leiden. \nProfessor Naudé discussed the impact of COVID-19 on trade and innovation, and presented some thought-provoking perspectives on the likely consequences of the pandemic on industrialization. He concluded by explaining how the pandemic will require a complete re-think of industrial policy. One issue he highlighted was that while t rade (in goods) is proving to be a real engine of recovery, many countries cannot benefit because of the mercantilist tendencies of some powerful states. Another serious concern for Naudé is the global dominance of a small number of tech giants which, he said, stifles competition and negatively impacts on digital innovation. \nUNIDO Director General LI Yong and UNCTAD Deputy Secretary-General Isabelle Durant voiced their support for the Group, while highlighting the urgent need for action. As UNIDO’s Li said, “The work of the ‘Friends of Industry and Innovation’ will be extremely important. We need this group to build the relationships necessary to direct trade, investment and technology towards the structural transformation that is needed to achieve inclusive and sustainable industrial development.” \nThe Group agreed to meet on a regular basis inviting an expert speaker to stimulate an open, non-politicized discussion on pertinent topics in the context of industrialization and SDG9. Members confirmed their commitment to advocate the need for greater support for SDG9 as well as foster partnerships to help achieve this goal, in the context of the Decade of Action. \nFor further information, contact: \nFrank Van Rompaey, \nUNIDO Representative to the UN and International Organisations, UNIDO Liaison Office, Geneva \nEmail \n", "issueTime": "9 October 2020"},

It is creating many challenges, yet also it unveils opportunities to build back better. In this context, inclusive and sustainable industrial development, which is at the core of SDG9, is expected to play a critical role in overcoming the crisis and setting countries back on the path of economic development. \nThe achievement of the SDGs in a post-COVID-19 world will require a holistic approach, including strong commitments towards the promotion of structural changes across all sectors of society. In this context, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network ( SDSN ) jointly organized a virtual event that addressed how the pandemic is impacting the SDGs, specifically SDG 9 , and the Agenda 2030 \nUNIDO’s Director General, LI Yong, opened up the event by emphasizing how Agenda 2030 is and still should be the roadmap to recovery. He also touched on the importance of achieving SDG9 to create a more sustainable industrial future and the need for reliable statistics and data, including UNIDO’s Industrial Analytics Platform and SDSN’s new data platform, SDGs Today . Li stated, “We must seize the opportunity to use the disruptive impact of the pandemic on the global economy to seek collaborative solutions to drive the 2030 Agenda.” \nGerhard Küntzle, Permanent Representative of Germany to the UN in Vienna, stated, “It is crystal clear that we must make the next ten years a decade of action and aim to mainstream evidence-based policymaking in the development agenda.” \nSDSN President, Jeffrey Sachs, highlighted the need for global collaboration, and how the world should turn toward six transformation pathways to achieve the SDGs amidst the pandemic. Sachs specifically highlighted the need for the first transformation relating to education, gender and inequality, and the sixth transformation relating to a Digital Revolution for Sustainable Development. \n“No child can have a future without education,” Sachs said, noting how access to the tools for free digital education for children is achievable with the right global collaboration. \nLastly, Sachs highlighted the need for decarbonizing industry: “Renewable energy is our theme and we must get to zero.” \nAs Ethiopia has undergone an industrial revolution from agricultural to manufacturing, the next speaker, Arkebe Oqubay, Minister and Special Advisor to the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, discussed lessons learned for the world to apply to achieve progress toward the SDGs. Oqubay highlighted three lessons: 1) Leadership and policymaking will need to be redefined in the new environment; 2) A commitment to green and carbon-neutral industrialization is vital; 3) Smart technologies will enable the wider application and use of green industries. \nLast but not least, Professor Oqubay noted that global collaboration has become the foundation for averting global threats and maximizing opportunities. \nAnn Rosenberg, co-founder of SDG Ambition UNGC , provided aprivate sector perspective and echoed Oqubay’s insights that all companies need to redefine production lines and industries. She said, “The hope from larger companies is that these smaller businesses and entrepreneurs will come up with new, redefined ways of doing things...There is a collective responsibility for everyone to help.” \nRosenberg stated that it is up to countries to figure out how to collaborate and how to access technology, so that all companies can advance industrially and toward the SDGs. Moreover, Rosenberg highlighted the need for tools to know where we are, so we know how we can close the gap to achieve the SDGs. \nAmbassador Martha Lungu Mwitumwa, Permanent Representative of Zambia to UNIDO and to the United Nations and other international organizations in Geneva, remarked on the need for more concentrated efforts towards achieving the SDGs, “With the crisis upon us, it will be far more difficult for Least Developed Countries and other low-income countries to achieve SDG 9. In this Decade of Action, we - as Ambassadors in Geneva - have a crucial role to play, in advocating the importance of industry and innovation, in mobilizing more resources towards it, and in fostering partnerships for leveraging trade, investment and technology to achieve that goal. And, as representatives of our countries to key UN institutions, we can foster greater UN coherence in these matters.” \nIt was clear that all panellists agreed that global collaboration is imperative to take the world through the recovery from COVID-19. Once out of recovery, panellists stressed how the focus should be on embracing the new, digital world to further three key initiatives: to bring access to education for all, to build sustainable industrialization, and to reach net-zero emissions. \nYou can watch the recording of the discussion on Youtube . \nFor more information, please contact: \nAdnan Seric \nIndustrial Policy Officer, Research and Industrial Policy Advice Division, UNIDO \nEmail \n", "issueTime": "22 October 2020"},

In an environment of turmoil, the rapid deterioration of human security in general and a marked increase in the vulnerability of the weakest are inevitable. The social and economic fabric of communities and families is damaged and productive capabilities are diminished. Frequently, these pressures lead to the dislocation of large numbers of people. The fate of recovery efforts in post-crisis situations is largely determined by the degree of success in making the transition from the initial emergency and relief stage to rehabilitation and reconstruction and ultimately to development. UNIDO is assisting its national partners in mobilizing the skills and expertise necessary to meet this challenge. By engaging crisis-affected communities in the development and application of custom tailored solutions, UNIDO plays a significant role in improving living standards and economic opportunities. Efforts aimed at strengthening the livelihood recovery process set the stage for development, and as such they render indispensable support to other reconstruction endeavours. In Afghanistan, Indonesia, Iraq, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malawi, Sudan and Uganda, UNIDO has been a valued participant in the overall recovery process.

While high-income countries add, on average, US$180 of value by processing one tonne of agricultural products, developing countries generate only US$40 of value per tonne. Increasing market opportunities particularly for small-scale producers in rural areas of developing countries by improving their production, processing and marketing capabilities, will be one of the main issues of a Global Agro-Industries Forum (GAIF), hosted by India in New Delhi from 8-11 April 2008. The first of its kind, the Forum will promote the importance of agro-industries for economic development and poverty reduction. This means delivering better products at lower prices for the benefit of poor consumers and creating employment opportunities. The Prime Minister of India , Manmohan Singh will officially inaugurate the Forum, together with Jacques Diouf, Director-General of FAO, Kandeh K.

The standard is intended to be broadly applicable to various sectors of national economies, including utility, manufacturing, commercial building, general commerce, and transportation sectors, and therefore, could have influence on as much as 60 % of the world’s energy demand. \nISO Secretary-General Alan Bryden commented: “The urgency to reduce GHG emissions, the reality of higher prices from reduced availability of fossil fuels, and the need to promote energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources, provide a strong rationale for developing this new standard building on the most advanced best practices and existing national or regional standards”. \nFollowing the successful examples of the ISO 9000 series on quality management and the ISO 14000 series on environmental management, the project committee ISO/PC 242, Energy management, will consider the development of a standard containing relevant terms and definitions and providing management system requirements together with guidance for use, implementation, measurement and metrics. \nThe standard will be based on the continual improvement and Plan-Do-Check-Act approach utilized in ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 to provide compatibility and integration opportunities. \nThe future standard is expected to: \nprovide organizations and companies (utilities, manufacturers, commerce, buildings, transportation, both private and public) with a well-recognized framework for integrating energy efficiency into their management practices \noffer organizations with operations in more than one country a single, harmonized standard for implementation across the organization \nprovide a logical and consistent methodology for identifying and implementing improvements that may contribute to a continual increase in energy efficiency across facilities \nassist organizations to better utilize existing energy consuming assets, thus reducing costs and/or expanding capacity \noffer guidance on benchmarking, measuring, documenting, and reporting energy intensity improvements and their projected impact on reductions in GHG emissions \ncreate transparency and facilitate communication on the management of energy, promote energy management best practices, thus reinforcing the value of good energy management behaviours \nassist facilities in evaluating and prioritizing the implementation of new energy-efficient technologies \nprovide a framework for organizations to encourage suppliers to better manage their energy, thus promoting energy efficiency throughout the supply chain \nfacilitate the use of energy management as a component of GHG emission reduction projects. \nThe secretariat of ISO/PC 242 will be held jointly by the ISO members for the United States and for Brazil: ANSI (American National Standardization Institute) and ABNT (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas). \nBeijing meeting \n", "issueTime": "1 April 2008"}
