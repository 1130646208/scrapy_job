He noted the need to improve skills, and the certification of products and services, and to increase transparency. “MSMEs are the key drivers of regional economic growth but the lockdown measures put in place in every country have impacted their ability to produce, trade and serve their communities as supply chains were disrupted,” lamented Kachka. \nNaira Margaryan, Armenia’s Deputy Minister of Economy, noted the imperative of building capacity for women and youth, given the paucity of leadership positions they occupy. She said, “Although the crisis has been devastating for some, for other businesses it creates new employment and self-employment opportunities. In Armenia, we are seeing women embrace this as an opportunity to step up, so, to support their efforts, we in the government are working to provide better access for women to enter business networks and are supporting capacity and skill-building, particularly in the manufacturing sector.” \nMilena Angelova, Vice-President of the EU’s European Economic and Social Committee , focused on the need for targeted investments to specific sectors, for digitalization of MSMEs, digital skills and financial support to MSMEs, particularly through enhanced partnerships. “The main challenge is to prevent any loss of industrial production but to do this, we need to map out the impact of the pandemic on individual sectors and countries to identify where support is needed the most. Until now, much of the business community’s response to the crisis has been on a local level. This approach will not deliver a sustainable recovery. To do so, we need to draw these efforts together, to form a network across Europe and Asia to build cohesion and a multiplier effect,” said Angelova. \nMaja Tomanic-Vidovic, Director, Slovene Enterprise Fund , noted that since the outbreak of COVID-19, 75 per cent of MSMEs had lost employees, 70 per cent had falling revenues, while 40 per cent suffer from liquidity issues. In the long-run, she noted, MSEMs will have to adapt to the accelerated paradigm of digitalization. She warned, “We have to accept that nothing will be the same as before…companies that don’t accept this will have problems in the future.\" Concluding, Jacek Cukrowski, Chief of UNIDO’s Regional Programme, Europe and Central Asia, noted that the MSME sector is the backbone of any national economy, and that innovation is “at the core of modern business”. He listed UNIDO’s interventions in this area, including tailored programmes for the digitalization of MSMEs, enhancing digital resilience and competitiveness, digital upskilling and training. Cukrowski stressed, “Ensuring [MSMEs’] resilience is key to creating a more inclusive and resilient, human-centered future and a thriving global economy.” \nTo see this session and the others in the GMIS Digital Series, click here .

The session featured UNIDO’s Cecilia Ugaz Estrada, Bright Simons, President, mPedigree, and Yi Xiaozhun, Deputy Director General of theWorld Trade Organization. \nYi stated that world merchandise trade may fall by 13 per cent due to the pandemic, and that the current disruption differs from that of the 2008 crisis. “I don’t believe that these changes are likely to stay with us forever,” he said. “Going forward, the structure of the supply chain will depend on whether the experience accelerates two trends that have been underway for several years. One trend is China moving up the value chain due to its industrial strategies or rising labour costs. Another important trend is increasing adoption of labour-saving technologies in modern manufacturing, such as industrial robots.. \nUgaz Estrada stressed that closing borders would reduce the potential for trade integration and warned of the potential erosion of comparative advantage in many developing countries. “I think developing countries have a real opportunity to be able to expand their markets by exporting to and importing from their neighbours…there remains the possibility of expanding markets by using trends of regionalization,” she said. \nUgaz Estrada also pinpointed a number of factors which would be key to SMEs in developing countries being able to absorb advanced manufacturing technologies in the current challenging environment. These include upgrading digital infrastructure; creating preparedness strategies; digital upskilling and training; empowering women; and creating strong multi-stakeholder partnerships. \n“It’s a moral imperative for international corporations to really provide a proper learning process for participation in the value chain; it’s a sine qua non condition. At UNIDO we are in the business of trying to help countries - the governments in particular -to be able to provide this learning infrastructure,” she said, citing UNIDO’s Centre for Mechatronics and Automation Technology in Uruguay as an example. \nSimons stressed the dampening effects of COVID-19 on regional integration, connectivity and trade, as well as possible border closures. \n“The barriers that COVID-19 has imposed affects regional trade, as much as it affects global trade,” he said. “So if you are following the discussion around the Continental Free Trade Agreement, which now has now been imperiled because of COVID-19, given that it is the avowed aim of all African governments to forward the continental integration agenda, it will be quite surprising if they will be able to achieve that by closing borders,” said Simons. \nHe mentioned that SMEs in Africa had often been constrained in exporting by stringent standards and certification requirements, but that technologies are emerging that are helping to streamline these processes. \nThe full stream of the session may be viewed here . \n", "issueTime": "3 July 2020"},

The policy is modeled on the Parity Panel Pledge of the International Gender Champions initiative , of which the UNIDO Director General, LI Yong, is a member . \nThe policy applies to all events organized by or under the auspices of UNIDO, including side-events, forums, meetings, workshops and roundtable or panel discussions, be it in-person or online. The policy requests personnel to ensure events are as gender-diverse as possible, and that no gender is restricted to the moderator of facilitator role. Exceptions are permitted for events focusing on women’s empowerment, where all-female list of speakers are permitted. Personnel are reminded of the importance of engaging men in events on gender equality to ensure the discussions’ greatest impact and with a view to promoting the transformation of social norms. \nThe policy states that “equal participation of women and men, as both speakers and attendees, is of great importance, as it brings different perspectives and ideas to the field of inclusive and sustainable industrial development and therefore increases the value and impact of events. Enhanced participation by women also creates more opportunities for them to develop networks, helps promote female role models and leaders, and contributes to eliminating gender stereotypes.” \nThis initiative goes beyond merely filling gender quotas - it involves a fundamental shift in all elements of event planning and promotion. UNIDO will expand its contacts networks and, to assist event organizers, an internal database of women experts in a wide variety of aspects of industrial development is being compiled. \nThe policy stipulates that event coverage on the UNIDO website and on social media channels will always include gender-diverse visual media, and all-male events will not be promoted. \nKai Bethke, Director of External Relations, said, “UNIDO is committed to promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment in the world, and this must begin within our own organization.” \nMuge Dolun, UNIDO’s Gender Coordinator ad interim, added, “Helping member states achieve inclusive and sustainable industrial development is the UNIDO mandate so it is crucial that women’s views, women’s voices, and women’s demands are heard loud and clear at UNIDO’s meetings. We hope to be able to set a precedent and that other entities join us in in this effort towards achieving gender equality.” \nThe policy is in line with a number of international frameworks, including the UNIDO Abu Dhabi Declaration of 2019 and UN Women ’ s Supplementary Guidance on the Enabling Environment Guidelines for the United Nations System (2019) . It also aligned with the 2019 UNIDO General Conference Resolution “UNIDO, Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women” ( GC.18/Res.2 ) as well as UNIDO’s 2019 Gender Policy and 2020-2023 Gender Strategy . \nFor more information, contact: \nMuge Dolun \nEmail \n", "issueTime": "10 July 2020"},

The Summit brought together leading branding experts and government representatives, and showcased success stories of Branding for Sustainability – a theme that raises awareness of brands’ impact on business performance, upgrading and sustainable development. \nThe event was held in an online and offline hybrid format, gathering hundreds of participants from government, business, academia and international organizations. Discussions highlighted the ever-growing importance of branding and intellectual property, particularly in times of COVID-19 and increased digitalization. \n“The pandemic has brought inevitable challenges, but also opportunities. As we have seen during this pandemic, digitalization has accelerated dramatically. It has opened a window of opportunity for new approaches, including in branding,” noted LI Yong, Director General of UNIDO. \nGerhard Hrebicek, President of the EBI, underlined the fact that “brands are the most valuable intangible assets that, unfortunately, remain the least understood”. \nUNIDO has pioneered branding as a tool for sustainable and inclusive industrial development. Since launching the service module, “Branding for competitiveness and sustainable growth (B4C)”, the approach has generated a number of success stories across the globe and industries. Examples of corporate - , destination -, city- and region- branding initiatives showd the value of (umbrella) branding initiatives for improving product quality, leading to more competitiveness, sales and contributing to sustainable development. \nInvestment in brands show superior returns and short payback times, as UNIDO’s project beneficiaries showcased. UNIDO’s branding initiatives have had a large impact on Armenia’s textile sector, Cuba’s agribusiness development, Namibia’s sustainable bush harvesting, Morocco and Tunisia’s food-processing, and Tajikistan’s carpet industries, leading to an increase in tax income, exports and job creation. \nRepresentatives from the private sector also emphasized the value of brands and highlighted the need for a uniform approach to brand evaluation. Only 10% of companies make use of brands, so “branding has to be democratized, proactively managed and measured, thereby resulting in increased competitiveness, innovation and sustainable development, contributing to the SDGs,” Hrebicek added. \nSpeakers identified financing for companies through brands and the potential and challenges of digitalization for brands as among the main challenges. It is easier than ever to become global, by going online, but that requires integrated planning and a strategic branding and digitalization initiative, suggested Austria's Federal Minister of Digital and Economic Affairs, Margarete Schramböck, who underlined that “branding for digitalization is key, and comes first in all the initiatives.” \nHhighlighting the benefits, UNIDO's Li noted: “As digitalization continues to accelerate dramatically during the pandemic, UNIDO incorporates the perspective of developing countries that turn towards innovation-intensive production and intelligent marketing, including strategic branding as a tool to advance inclusive and sustainable industrial development”. \nTo address the challenges going forward, UNIDO and the EBI will further expand their branding activities globally. Raising awareness of the value of brands and realize their potential for sustainability will require the combined efforts of this partnership, the private sector’s awareness and public support. Bringing the discussion to the highest levels and decision-makers, branding can guide companies on innovative paths to increase their value added and achieve sustainability. Therefore, UNIDO and EBI are planning a Brand Global Summit roadshow, with worldwide coverage, to address the bottlenecks of branding and increase strategic brand management’s efficacy for sustainable development. \nFor more information on the Brand Global Summit 2020, click here . \nTo view the Brand Global Summit broadcasted on YouTube, click here . \nFor more information on the joint UNIDO-EBI initiative, click here . \nFor further information, contact: \nFarrukh Alimdjanov, Industrial Development Officer, UNIDO Department of Digitalization, Technology and Innovation \nEmail \n", "issueTime": "1 October 2020"},

Other second phase project partners include South Africa’s Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, which funds the NCPC-SA, the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources, and its agency, the South African National Energy Development Institute (SANEDI). \nAccording to Hartzenburg, what sets this project apart is that it partners with and equips industry to tackle practical energy management in companies of all sizes. \nHe said, “Through expert-level training of industry professionals, demonstration of actual impact and methodologies aligned to international standard ISO 50001, the project partners have ensured that both the skills and the appetite exist to implement energy management.” \nHartzenburg continued, “The benefits are made clear in the energy savings, which result in direct financial savings on utilities and other energy sources, and we don’t leave the companies to go it alone, but support them with skills and financial linkages, where possible.” \nHartzenburg believes that the return to post-lockdown operations offers companies an ideal opportunity to consider changes that will ultimately save them operating costs, thus aiding in the recovery process and long-term sustainability. \n“SANS/ISO 50001, the energy management best practice standard, actually saves companies money. We are offering companies technical support to comply with this standard, and even some financial support if they want to apply for certification through the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS).” \nHartzenburg said his team is particularly proud of the huge environmental impact of the project. “Energy savings, particularly in a fossil-fuel based economy such as South Africa, have a direct climate mitigation benefit - which is why the GEF has funded our second phase.” \nBased on internationally accepted calculations, the NCPC-SA reports that energy saved by companies through the IEE project has mitigated 6.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) since April 2011 when the first savings were measured. \nSANEDI is working with the information gathered through the NCPC-SA interventions, and is using them together with relevant international and national energy trends to inform national energy and policy planning, including the adaptation of the National Energy Efficiency Strategy. \nRana Ghoneim, head of UNIDO’s Energy Systems and Infrastructure Division, said the award was an excellent recognition of the strong ownership, committed leadership and multi-stakeholder partnership that is driving industrial energy efficiency in South Africa. “The programme has always been a great example, inspiring other countries within the UNIDO global programme, where its impacts transcend beyond South Africa.” \nThe IEE project has a strong focus on gender mainstreaming and promoting the participation of women in energy. To date, 43% of the professionals trained through the project are female. \nThe project also includes awareness-raising in its activities, as evidence strongly supports the idea that sustained energy savings are brought about through behaviour change. This active communication approach made the project an even stronger candidate for the AEE International Award which encourages projects with “significant success in savings and/or visibility”. \nSee a fact sheet on the South Africa Industrial Energy Efficiency Project here . \nFor more information, contact: \nJulie Wells,Communication Manager, NCPC-SA \nCell: +27 (0)74899 9819 \nEmail: jwells@csir.co.za \nPetro de Wet, UNIDO South Africa \nCell: +27 (0)60679 1359 \nEmail: p.dewet@unido.org \n", "issueTime": "15 October 2020"},

It is creating many challenges, yet also it unveils opportunities to build back better. In this context, inclusive and sustainable industrial development, which is at the core of SDG9, is expected to play a critical role in overcoming the crisis and setting countries back on the path of economic development. \nThe achievement of the SDGs in a post-COVID-19 world will require a holistic approach, including strong commitments towards the promotion of structural changes across all sectors of society. In this context, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network ( SDSN ) jointly organized a virtual event that addressed how the pandemic is impacting the SDGs, specifically SDG 9 , and the Agenda 2030 \nUNIDO’s Director General, LI Yong, opened up the event by emphasizing how Agenda 2030 is and still should be the roadmap to recovery. He also touched on the importance of achieving SDG9 to create a more sustainable industrial future and the need for reliable statistics and data, including UNIDO’s Industrial Analytics Platform and SDSN’s new data platform, SDGs Today . Li stated, “We must seize the opportunity to use the disruptive impact of the pandemic on the global economy to seek collaborative solutions to drive the 2030 Agenda.” \nGerhard Küntzle, Permanent Representative of Germany to the UN in Vienna, stated, “It is crystal clear that we must make the next ten years a decade of action and aim to mainstream evidence-based policymaking in the development agenda.” \nSDSN President, Jeffrey Sachs, highlighted the need for global collaboration, and how the world should turn toward six transformation pathways to achieve the SDGs amidst the pandemic. Sachs specifically highlighted the need for the first transformation relating to education, gender and inequality, and the sixth transformation relating to a Digital Revolution for Sustainable Development. \n“No child can have a future without education,” Sachs said, noting how access to the tools for free digital education for children is achievable with the right global collaboration. \nLastly, Sachs highlighted the need for decarbonizing industry: “Renewable energy is our theme and we must get to zero.” \nAs Ethiopia has undergone an industrial revolution from agricultural to manufacturing, the next speaker, Arkebe Oqubay, Minister and Special Advisor to the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, discussed lessons learned for the world to apply to achieve progress toward the SDGs. Oqubay highlighted three lessons: 1) Leadership and policymaking will need to be redefined in the new environment; 2) A commitment to green and carbon-neutral industrialization is vital; 3) Smart technologies will enable the wider application and use of green industries. \nLast but not least, Professor Oqubay noted that global collaboration has become the foundation for averting global threats and maximizing opportunities. \nAnn Rosenberg, co-founder of SDG Ambition UNGC , provided aprivate sector perspective and echoed Oqubay’s insights that all companies need to redefine production lines and industries. She said, “The hope from larger companies is that these smaller businesses and entrepreneurs will come up with new, redefined ways of doing things...There is a collective responsibility for everyone to help.” \nRosenberg stated that it is up to countries to figure out how to collaborate and how to access technology, so that all companies can advance industrially and toward the SDGs. Moreover, Rosenberg highlighted the need for tools to know where we are, so we know how we can close the gap to achieve the SDGs. \nAmbassador Martha Lungu Mwitumwa, Permanent Representative of Zambia to UNIDO and to the United Nations and other international organizations in Geneva, remarked on the need for more concentrated efforts towards achieving the SDGs, “With the crisis upon us, it will be far more difficult for Least Developed Countries and other low-income countries to achieve SDG 9. In this Decade of Action, we - as Ambassadors in Geneva - have a crucial role to play, in advocating the importance of industry and innovation, in mobilizing more resources towards it, and in fostering partnerships for leveraging trade, investment and technology to achieve that goal. And, as representatives of our countries to key UN institutions, we can foster greater UN coherence in these matters.” \nIt was clear that all panellists agreed that global collaboration is imperative to take the world through the recovery from COVID-19. Once out of recovery, panellists stressed how the focus should be on embracing the new, digital world to further three key initiatives: to bring access to education for all, to build sustainable industrialization, and to reach net-zero emissions. \nYou can watch the recording of the discussion on Youtube . \nFor more information, please contact: \nAdnan Seric \nIndustrial Policy Officer, Research and Industrial Policy Advice Division, UNIDO \nEmail \n", "issueTime": "22 October 2020"},

The meeting was complemented with a presentation by Wim Naudé, Professor at Maastricht School of Management, as well as Fellow at the African Studies Centre at the University of Leiden. \nProfessor Naudé discussed the impact of COVID-19 on trade and innovation, and presented some thought-provoking perspectives on the likely consequences of the pandemic on industrialization. He concluded by explaining how the pandemic will require a complete re-think of industrial policy. One issue he highlighted was that while t rade (in goods) is proving to be a real engine of recovery, many countries cannot benefit because of the mercantilist tendencies of some powerful states. Another serious concern for Naudé is the global dominance of a small number of tech giants which, he said, stifles competition and negatively impacts on digital innovation. \nUNIDO Director General LI Yong and UNCTAD Deputy Secretary-General Isabelle Durant voiced their support for the Group, while highlighting the urgent need for action. As UNIDO’s Li said, “The work of the ‘Friends of Industry and Innovation’ will be extremely important. We need this group to build the relationships necessary to direct trade, investment and technology towards the structural transformation that is needed to achieve inclusive and sustainable industrial development.” \nThe Group agreed to meet on a regular basis inviting an expert speaker to stimulate an open, non-politicized discussion on pertinent topics in the context of industrialization and SDG9. Members confirmed their commitment to advocate the need for greater support for SDG9 as well as foster partnerships to help achieve this goal, in the context of the Decade of Action. \nFor further information, contact: \nFrank Van Rompaey, \nUNIDO Representative to the UN and International Organisations, UNIDO Liaison Office, Geneva \nEmail \n", "issueTime": "9 October 2020"},

This is important as many decision-makers currently lack the tools to directly compare green or hybrid infrastructure solutions with alternatives, for instance when making decisions about flood control, food security, coastal protection, water conservation and wastewater treatment. Such infrastructure planning and spending decisions will be critically important in the coming years as countries plan their recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and work toward more ambitious climate change, biodiversity, and other goals and frameworks. “We are proud to support this venture, which will address the critical evidence gap that investors and project developers currently face as they evaluate whether to invest in nature and nature-based infrastructure,” said GEF CEO and Chairperson Naoko Ishii. “Making this information more readily available will be a game changer for those making long-term decisions about infrastructure investments for economic recovery and development.” The MAVA Foundation , a philanthropic organization working to conserve biodiversity for the benefit of people and nature, is partnering with the GEF and has pledged to provide $2 million in co-financing to scale up the impact of the project, which will be implemented by UNIDO and executed by IISD . The project, which will use data from the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, will also include a public online database making information on the valuation and performance of nature-based infrastructure available to a wide variety of project partners and stakeholders. \n“Nature is part of the fundamental infrastructure on which thriving societies and economies depend. Despite its regenerative capacity, natural infrastructure – like built infrastructure - needs maintenance and therefore investment. This project will demonstrate that investing in maintaining and restoring our natural capital provides solutions to societal problems – above all to the adaptation to climate change. Most importantly, the training and capacity development offered will scale the project impact far beyond the concrete case examples,” said MAVA Foundation Director General Lynda Mansson . \n\"Our aim for this project is to consider social, economic, and environmental factors to demonstrate the system-wide case for investing in large-scale nature-based solutions,” said IISD President and CEO Richard Florizone. “Natural ecosystems like forests, mangroves, wetlands, and grasslands provide a range of ‘services’ that can complement and even substitute for built infrastructure. The strongevidence basewe build through this unique partnership will help all market participants confidently invest in nature.\" \n“In line with UNIDO’s mandate to promote inclusive and sustainable industrial development, we actively cooperate with private sector entities to further environmental stewardship approaches. This project will allow us to quantify the positive impact of stewardship activities on ecosystems as well as to demonstrate the cost efficiency of nature-based infrastructure. It will also allow us to highlight the economic value of the positive externalities provided by nature-based infrastructure to our partners in governments and international finance institutions. Thus, the project will have a catalytic impact on UNIDO’s efforts to up-scale public-private partnerships on environmental stewardship as required for a transformational change in climate change adaptation,” said UNIDO Managing Director Stephan Sicars . The new project is an example of the GEF’s ongoing commitment to help countries and partners make wise investment decisions related to nature-based solutions and climate resilience, and reflects the Special Climate Change Fund’s focus on supporting innovative and impactful adaptation solutions. It will also support the Global Commission on Adaptation ’s call to scale up action on nature-based solutions for adaptation.

Since then, the GEF has provided more than $20 billion in grants and mobilized an additional $112 billion in co-financing for more than 4,800 projects in 170 countries. Through its Small Grants Programme, the GEF has provided support to nearly 24,000 civil society and community initiatives in 133 countries. About the SCCF The Special Climate Change Fund was established in response to guidance from the Conference of the Parties (COP7) in Marrakech in 2001. The SCCF complements the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), another GEF-managed trust fund focused on climate change adaptation. Unlike the LDCF, the SCCF is open to all vulnerable developing countries. In addition, it funds a wider range of activities related to climate change with a specific focus on innovation. To date the SCCF has a portfolio of more than $350 million supporting 85 projects globally. \n", "issueTime": "2 million 2020"},

COVID-19 has precipitated this situation where digitalization is taking centre-stage.” Professor Stefano Fantoni of the Euroscience Open Forum 2020 stressed the integration of science and manufacturing and innovation systems, especially for sustainability, “the common denominator”. \nYusuke Kajihara, Associate Professor, Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo, identified two common problems with design optimization, namely obtaining micro-scale dynamics and rapid assembly. He advocated that through combining THZ nanoscopy, adhesiveless joining and artificial intelligence, we could improve time productivity ten-fold and working productivity 100-fold, especially through new innovations such as atomic layer semi-conductors, artificial organs, micro-needles and implantable devices in the brain. \nAlina Sorgner, Assistant Professor of Data Analytics, John Cabot University, Rome, observed that while women’s participation in the workforce was increasing, there was also a defeminization of labour in the manufacturing sector. This, she said, could be exacerbated as new modes of production require new skills which are often in short supply at present, particularly in developing countries. She added that as gender inequality is often locally determined, glocal and long-term approaches were required. \n“In a nutshell, Industry 4.0 has enormous potential to improve our welfare, our well-being. However, the defeminization of the manufacturing sector can also lead to certain new types of gender inequalities,” said Sorgner. \nBill Huang, CEO and Founder, CloudMinds, focused on cloud robotics, noting the potential of 5G and neural networks to build much more complex robots. These had been deployed to deliver medicines and to act as nursing assistants during the pandemic, he said. \nAndrey Suvorov, Head of Business Development, IIOT Cyber Security, Kaspersky Lab, addressed skills and training issues, citing these as common challenges globally. He identified a number of essential skills for the workers of the future, including being able to use and design AI analytics; creative problem solving; working safely and effectively with new technologies; having strong cybersecurity skills; and possessing entrepreneurial skills. \nTo watch the GMIS Digital Series session and others in the series, click on the following link: https://www.gmisummit.com/watch-gmis2020/ \nTo register to view the GMIS Summit, click on the following URL: https://www.gmisummit.com/gmis-digital-series \nFor further information contact: \nBernardo Calzadilla-Sarmiento, Managing Director, Directorate of Digitalization, Technology and Agri-Business. \nEmail \n", "issueTime": "18 August 2020"},

Considering that the food and agricultural sector accounts for ten percent of global GDP and employs an estimated 1.5 billion people worldwide, the outbreak of COVID-19 will likely have far-reaching and noticeable social and economic consequences for the sector. \nIn order to evaluate those effects, the UNIDO Investment and Technology Promotion Office (ITPO) Germany , in cooperation with the German Agricultural Society (DLG e.V.), and SmartHectar Innovation, initiated an online survey among 800 companies from the European and especially German food and agricultural sector with business activities in African and Southeast Asian markets. The survey was conducted by dimap, the German Institute for Market and Political Research, between June and July 2020. The majority of participants were small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) headquartered in Europe, while a third of the participants represent larger corporations. Two-thirds of the respondents generate more than half of their annual turnover on foreign markets. \nThe survey confirmed that the coronavirus pandemic indeed represents a huge challenge to companies operating in the food and agribusiness sectors. While the immediate effects on business operations in African and Southeast Asian markets are still limited, they are already more pronounced in Europe in the form of reduced production and cancelled orders. However, despite the looming crisis, the long-term outlook of most companies remains rather positive, with only about ten percent of respondents pondering layoffs or closing down part of their business in foreign markets. The survey further revealed that many companies see the diversification of their product, supplier and customer base as suitable medium- to long-term strategies to cope with the effects of the crisis. Moreover, one-third of respondents consider expanding their research and development activities as a response to the pandemic. \nA majority of SMEs see the opening of new markets and continued international expansion as the right way to adapt to the crisis. Keeping markets open is seen as crucial to ensure global food supplies and to maintain social and economic stability. The respondents are convinced that trade liberalization has to be accompanied by active measures aimed at strengthening local supply chains and facilitating industrial upgrading of agricultural and food-processing industries. \nThe results of the survey validate the approach of ITPO Germany and its partners in respect of their continued efforts to support technology providers and investors in the food-processing and agricultural sectors in developing countries and emerging markets, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia. \nTo read more, please access the survey report through this link . \nFor more information contact ITPO Germany: itpo.germany@unido.org \n", "issueTime": "11 August2020 2020"},

The report also highlights the impact of the pandemic on specific regions and population groups. \nThe information contained in the report is even grimmer than in the first volume, confirming the unprecedented impact of the pandemic on the economic and social fabric of our societies. Some key findings are as follows: \nTrends in COVID-19 caseloads differ widely by country, illustrating the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and the importance of remaining vigilant in our battle against the virus; \nGlobal foreign direct investment is now projected to fall by as much as 40 percent in 2020; \nGlobal manufacturing output fell by 20 per cent in April 2020 compared to the same period of the previous year, accelerating an already declining trend; \nThe pandemic is pushing an additional 71 to 100 million people into extreme poverty; \nGlobally, the first quarter of 2020 saw a loss of the equivalent to 155 million full-time jobs, a number that increased to 400 million in the second quarter, with lower- and middle-income countries hardest hit; \nEven before the pandemic, women did three times more unpaid domestic and care work than men; since the pandemic, however, data from rapid gender assessment surveys indicate that women in some regions are shouldering the extra burden of an increased workload, particularly in terms of childcare and household chores. \nThe United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) contributed a section on world manufacturing production. While the majority of the observed countries, both industrialized and developing or emerging countries, registered a significant decrease in production, developing and emerging industrial economies witnessed more intense production decreases than industrialized countries. Only a few countries, such as the Republic of Korea, maintained a stable production level. Aggregate data for industrial groups reveal lower losses in June for electronics, machinery and electrical equipment, whereas in previous months the less affected groups were those producing basic consumer needs such as food and beverages. \nThe report also provides a glimpse of the challenges faced by national statistical systems. At a time when reliable information is more essential than ever, many systems are struggling to compile basic statistics, due in part to the pandemic but also because of a lack of resources needed to modernize operations and infrastructures. \nHow COVID-19 is changing the world: a statistical perspective Volume II \nFor more information, please contact UNIDO Statistics . \n", "issueTime": "11 September 2020"},

We are very pleased to have the Principality of Monaco as a new partner in this area. Together we can do a lot in the future.” \nIsabelle Rosabrunetto remarked that the Principality of Monaco has been a member of the UfM since 2008 and a member of UNIDO since 2003. At the instigation of the Prince’s family, Monaco has long implemented a policy in favour of women's rights. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), actions are carried out in various fields including socio-economic integration. \"I am sure that our teams will follow this great initiative in the service of women's entrepreneurship with great interest,\" she said. \nThe UfM Secretary General, Nasser Kamel, underlined that “the objective of enhancing women’s economic inclusion and harnessing the great potential of women entrepreneurs in the Euro-Mediterranean region is fully in line with the UfM‘s strategy and action\". He continued, \"The tripartite joint cooperation with UNIDO, the Principality of Monaco and the UfM is a testimony to our commitment to women's economic empowerment to create the conditions for a sustainable and inclusive growth in the region.” \nThe objective of the agreement, foreseen to last four years , is to promote the development of women-led micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in order to create more business opportunities and jobs for women of working age in Tunisia. \nThe specific aim is to increase access of women-led companies creating cosmetic and para-pharmaceutical products based on natural products to national and international markets. In Tunisia this production covers essential oils, floral waters, and aromatic and medicinal plants, as well as perfumes, creams, masks and soaps. The sector has a large female workforce. \nThe global market for these products has been growing over the last decade (by an average of 4% per year) and Tunisia has certain comparative advantages such as an organic certification system approved by the European Union and the Swiss Federation, as well as a wide availability of raw materials, particularly organic produce. However, the sector is poorly organized and the many, very small enterprises that make up the sector encounter difficulties in accessing national and international markets. \nThis pilot intervention is part of a broader initiative aiming to empower urban and rural women in seven countries (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine and Tunisia) in the Middle East and North Africa region. \"Promoting Women's Empowerment for Inclusive and Sustainable Industrial Development in the MENA Region (PWE)\", funded by the Italian Government, was awarded the UfM label in 2015.The UfM label provides support for the implementation of the project through the provision of technical expertise, networking opportunities and enhanced visibility in order to promote innovative practices at the regional level. \nFor more information on the UfM and its mission, please see link . \nFor more information at UNIDO, please contact: \nFlorian Iwinjak \nEmail \n", "issueTime": "2008 and 2020"},

With funding from the Government of Japan, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) has implemented a project to create employment and income opportunities for internally displaced people and their host communities by providing skills and entrepreneurship training, and by establishing the basic facilities for agro-processing. \nTo mark the completion of the project, two events have been held in the presence of the Ambassador-designate of Japan to South Sudan, Naohiro Tsutsumi, and the Minister of Trade and Industry , Kuol Athian Mawien . On 15 September, a refurbished edible oil processing work space in Gumbo was handed over to project implementation partner, the Mazzarello Women Promotion Centre, which is administered by the Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco-Gumbo. On 17 September, a ceremony marked the hand-over of the Agro-processing Training Centre at the South Sudan National Bureau of Standards (SSNBS). \nThe project, which began in April 2019, has trained 244 internally displaced people and members of host communities in entrepreneurship development, and group savings and loans, as well as in the extraction of edible oil from sesame seeds and groundnuts, including the post-harvest handling of raw materials. Eighteen officials from the SSNBS under the Ministry of Trade and Industry, and from the Drugs and Food Control Authority under the Ministry of Health were trained (training of trainers) in food safety. Thanks to the income from producing and selling safe and nutritious edible oil, it is expected that internally displaced people and host community groups will become more financially self-reliant. \nOn the occasion of the events, Japan’s Ambassador-designate Tsutumi congratulated the project beneficiaries on their achievements.

The dramatic drop reflects the economic impact of measures imposed to halt the spread of COVID-19, which overshadowed all other negative influences on the sector, including higher trade barriers and the impact of Brexit. \nUNIDO anticipates ongoing disruptions to manufacturing over the coming months as the world continues to grapple with the impacts of the pandemic. “Based on this scenario, and on developments in manufacturing linked to other economic variables, UNIDO is forecasting a fall in global manufacturing value added of 8.4 per cent in 2020, which would mark the biggest collapse in output since official records began,” UNIDO Chief Statistician Fernando Cantu said. \nSome countries are likely to be harder hit than others, with China expected to record a more modest drop of 1.6 per cent compared with the United States and Europe’s industrialized economies where value added in 2020 is forecast to plummet by 15 per cent and 14.3 per cent, respectively. \nCantu noted, however, that more time was needed to assess the full impact of containment measureson households, businesses and government balance sheets. In addition, he cautioned that “recent developments in several countries point to a possible second wave of the pandemic , which could require the return of harsher economic restrictions, with knock-on effects on supply and demand”. \nFigures for the second quarter show a wide divergence between China and the rest of the world, as well as between and within developing and industrialized economies. China was one of the first countries to impose a lockdown and most of the impact was felt during the first three months of the year. By the second quarter, China’s manufacturing output had already returned to growth, increasing by 2.8 per cent year-on-year, led by industries such as computer electronics (11.2 per cent), electrical equipment (6.8 per cent) and machinery (6.3 per cent). \nOn the other hand, the data for developing and emerging industrial economies (excluding China) show a markedly gloomier picture, with second-quarter output plunging by 22 per cent on the year following a 2.3 per cent drop in the first quarter. \nThe hardest hit geographical region was Latin America, where manufacturing output fell by 24.2 per cent year-on-year, followed by Asia and the Pacific, which saw a 23.7 per cent drop. \nIn industrialized economies, second-quarter manufacturing output sank by 16.4 per cent as economic recessions started to bite in many major economies. Europe’s manufacturing production dropped by 19.3 per cent, making it the worst-affected industrialized region, according to the UNIDO report. The sharp decline intensified a trend seen in previous quarters, particularly affecting export-oriented economies, amid ongoing trade frictions with the United States and the uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union. \nGiven the characteristics of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, there were substantial differences in manufacturing output per sector in recent months. For example, production of essential goods and supplies, such as food and pharmaceutical products, was less affected than other industries. Production of basic pharmaceuticals in all country groups in the second quarter of 2020 showed moderate growth, while the production of capital and durable goods, such as machinery and motor vehicles, dropped sharply over the same period due to shrinking demand. \nThe full report is available here . \nAll data and analysis is based on seasonally adjusted data. \nUNIDO regularly releases statistics on current growth trends of global manufacturing at country and regional level.

The outbreak of COVID-19 threatens to reverse economic and social progress achieved in the region over the last decade; moreover, it compromises prospects of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. \nIn this context, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the Latin American Network for the study of Learning Systems, Innovation and Skills Construction ( LALICS ) together organized a webinar titled: “Technological revolutions, changes in lifestyles and sustainable industrial development in Latin America and the Caribbean in a post-COVID-19 world”. The webinar served as platform where more than a hundred researchers, policymakers and practitioners discussed pressing challenges and opportunities, taking into account both the current health and economic crises, and the aforementioned structural problems faced by the region. \nIn his opening remarks, Diego Masera, Chief and Deputy Director Regional Coordination Division - Latin America and the Caribbean, highlighted the severity of the pandemic. According to the Economic Commission of Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), in 2020, the region’s GDP will fall by 9.1% in annual terms , with a drastic decline in manufacturing production. Masera emphasized the pertinence of identifying alternative development models that would reduce the risk of falling into an even greater crisis due to climate change. He endorsed the UN General Secretary, Antonio Guterres who, in his recent report on the impact of COVID-19 in Latin America and the Caribbean (July 2020) , asserts that the crisis calls for a reassessment of the roles of the State, the market and of civil society, in order to improve equality, transparency and democracy in the region. \nIn the search of long-term solutions, Masera stressed that the promotion of sustainable and inclusive industrial policies, the integration of informal workers into formal and decent work, as well as investment in research and development are crucial factors to consider. SDG9, which promotes inclusive and sustainable industrial development, innovation and resilient infrastructure, should be a central element in the development agenda of countries in the region. He stated that UNIDO, in accordance with its mandate to promote sustainable and inclusive industrial development, is ready to assist member states in the region to achieve a fast recovery from this crisis, and to prepare and build the strengths needed to give local populations a better future. \nProf. Gabriela Dutrénit, Professor at the Department of Economics and the Postgraduate Programe in Economics and Management of Innovation Policies at the Autonomous Metropolitan University Xochimilco in Mexico City, and President of the Scientific Board of LALICS, described the current events as an historical moment marked by changes in various areas that highlight the challenges of building innovation capacities in order to reduce dependencies on external technologies and knowledge, while also opening new development opportunities. Latin America, in particular, faces new possibilities for closing gaps and contributing to an inclusive and sustainable development. She appealed to the LALICS network to rethink and propose new courses of action driven by innovation policy and productive transformation while, at the same time, building the necessary resilience to confront future crises. \nThe main speaker for the webinar was Prof. Carlota Pérez, British-Venezuelan researcher, lecturer and international consultant specializing in technology and socio-economic development. Addressing the question of what influence the COVID-19 pandemic could have on the growth prospects of Latin America and the Caribbean, Pérez noted that, based on historic experience, such influence would depend on how much the pandemic can affect the pace and direction of the ongoing technological revolution in industrialized countries. In her opinion, the present situation is comparable to the post-war era, and we are moving to a situation requiring an active and omnipresent state. The challenge however, is not to replicate the past but to take a leap forward. In a scenario where Asia dominates the manufacturing of products, the opportunity for Latin America is to focus on processing industries and in the valorization of natural resources, targeting increasingly specialized, high-value markets. However, because processing industries tend to be labour-saving, she proposed a dual but integrated strategy, one that realizes potential productivity in every part of the territory, tapping into hyper-segmented markets and capitalizing on new forms of communication, transport and logistics. \nAccording to Pérez, demand for natural resources-driven innovation will continue to grow, as production methods and lifestyles increasingly orientate towards environmental sustainability. She asserted that success in implementing this dual strategy depends on the ability to build private-public consensus framed by appropriate supporting institutions at the two ends of the strategy. \nLastly, during her intervention, Professor Helena Lastres, Associated Professor at the Institute of Economics, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, noted that the pandemic is worsening the already complex political, economic and social situation experienced in Brazil and other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. In her opinion, the situation is best described in the words of the late Brazilian economist Celso Furtado: “In no other moment in our history is the distance between where we are, and where we expected to be, as great as it is today.” \nAccording to Lastres, addressing the crisis and fostering development in a post-pandemic future for Latin America and the Caribbean requires a strengthening of the role of the State, and a recovery of its development-promoting functions in the region. At the same time, she noted the growing importance of digitalization and the rapid adoption of information and communication technologies (ICT), together with the relevance of building national consensus around the pressing development needs affecting the future of Latin America.

UNIDO is the specialized agency of the United Nations, which promotes inclusive and sustainable industrial development (ISID) for poverty reduction, inclusive globalization, and environmental sustainability. \nUNIDO joined the WorldSkills Conference Coalition to contribute and to share its knowledge and experience on demand-driven industrial skills development and the role that public-private development partnerships (PPDP) can play in providing technical education. \nThe Coalition is a group of representatives from international, regional, and national organizations that help to develop the content of each edition of the WorldSkills Conference and shape the strategic direction of the WorldSkills Conference programme. For UNIDO, the challenge lays in the content and quality of Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET) programmes. In many countries, there is a mismatch in the TVET offer and the demand from the private sector. As a result, graduates cannot find jobs while employers cannot find skilled personnel. \n“ UNIDO is another excellent addition to the WorldSkills Conference Coalition ” , said David Hoey, CEO of WorldSkills International. “ We now have a formidable range of organizations participating including UN agencies, other international organizations, regional organizations, and national institutions. Together they are helping to establish the WorldSkills Conference as a must-attend biennial event. ” \n“ Skills development is an important element for an inclusive and sustainable industrial sector. The UNIDO-WorldSkills partnership ensures that the skills development grows in line with the needs and demands of the industrial sector and its key players. ” , said LI Yong, Director General of UNIDO. “ UNIDO is pleased to join the WorldSkills Conference Coalition and we look forward to contributing to the work of the Coalition, and to exchange our best practices and knowledge related to industrial skills demand and future skills requirements. ” \nThe UNIDO and WorldSkills collaboration is already in operation. We are excited to have WorldSkills co-hosting the UNIDO Learning and Knowledge Development Facility (LKDF) Forum in October 2020 to help identify green industrial skills and highlight the need to introduce green skills programmes to ensure a sustainable and inclusive future. In addition, UNIDO will contribute to the programme of the next WorldSkills Conference to be held in Shanghai in September 2021 as part of WorldSkills Shanghai 2021.

But, more than this, industry can be key to building back better, to safeguarding prosperity for the long term. \nRepresentatives of Germany and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) met today and agreed on the importance of industrialization in meeting the immediate needs of those across the world affected by the COVID-19 crisis. \nGerd Müller, Federal Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany, and LI Yong, UNIDO Director General, signed the Roadmap for our future and present cooperation between Germany and UNIDO. The Roadmap outlines ways in which the two partners will work together to increase productivity, boost trade and promote investment in order to create jobs and rehabilitate small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and value chains. \nMüller stated his belief that industrial development will play a decisive role in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) but said that \"we must move faster\", adding that multilateral initiatives such as the Roadmap can help accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. \nGermany and UNIDO’s shared concept is that industrialization can provide socio-economic opportunities for those suffering from the fallout from the pandemic. Looking ahead, the two partners also agreed that industrial approaches can and must be re-imagined and industrial policies re-focused. Inclusive and sustainable industrial development can spur innovation, make the Fourth Industrial Revolution work for the good of all, reduce climate change impacts, and increase the circularity of supply chains, but, most importantly, lays the foundation for the creation of a resilient infrastructure which allows for economic stability and growth. \nIn view of their most pressing needs, sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA) region, least developed countries (LDCs) and the Vulnerable Twenty Group (V20) willbe a focus for future cooperation. However, the Roadmap envisages inclusive and sustainable industrial development that will share the benefits of long-term emission reductions and well-being around the globe. \nGermany has been a key member of UNIDO since June 1985 and has contributed to the shaping of UNIDO's policies and resolutions as a platform for dialogue around industrial development. Moreover, Germany is a critical contributor of assessed contributions and an important contributor of voluntary contributions to the organization. \nUNIDO has been an important partner for Germany. It is a specialized agency of the United Nations, uniquely placed to support to Member States with the implementation of the SDG 9 since it has industry and innovation in its core mandate. \nIn November 2019, at UNIDO’s General Conference in Abu Dhabi, UNIDO and its Member States committed to promoting knowledge-based, environmentally responsible, resource- and energy-saving industrial development that involves the private sector, reduces poverty and benefits all segments of the population. \nFor further information, contact: \nKai Bethke, UNIDO Director of External Relations \nE mail \n", "issueTime": "1 September 2020"},

It took place withinthe framework of the UNIDO project, “Promoting Women’s Empowerment (PWE) for Inclusive and Sustainable Industrial Development in the MENA Region, which is funded by the Italian Government, \nUNIDO Director General LI Yong opened the conference, acknowledging the unique challenges the world is facing in 2020, as well as marking the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which, he said, “is a crucial pillar for the promotion of gender equality and women’s empowerment. \nLi further reaffirmed UNIDO’s commitment to addressing gender inequalities in industry and to harnessing women’s full potential as leaders and economic agents of change, thereby transforming economies and generating inclusive growth. “The Fourth Industrial Revolution is ripe with promise. Let us all work together to ensure that women benefit equally by participating in, shaping and pushing the frontiers of industry and innovation. ” \nItaly’s Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Emanuela del Re, highlighted the importance of women entrepreneurs as engines of the recovery from the current crisis, while the Director General of FAO, QU Dongyu, insisted that women’s leadership as farmers, traders and entrepreneurs are key to achieving the SDGs, including the eradication of hunger and malnutrition. \nThe Regional Director of UN Women for the Arab States, Moez Doraid, spoke of the importance of technology and innovation for the empowerment of women in a statement delivered on behalf of UN Women Executive Director, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka. \nConference outcomes \nFirst, governments play a crucial role in creating an ecosystem that allows women to move into high-value addition sectors through the mainstreaming of women entrepreneurship and job creation. Moreover, applying a gender lens to the design of economic policies should play a crucial part of the recovery from the current crisis. \nSecond, the empowerment of women means ensuring that girls can engage in technology studies from an early age and progress into science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields of education and work. \nThird, women entrepreneurs need to be supported through the removal of barriers and biases that prevent the upgrading of technical knowledge and access to markets, finance and infrastructure. These measures require stronger multi-stakeholder partnerships with a strong role for the private sector in fighting biases and facilitating upscaling of women’s contributions. \nFinally, networking exists in many forms and all need to be fostered for a more meaningful participation of women in the economy and society at large. \nUNIDO will take the lessons learnt during the conference to bolster its activities in boosting employment and entrepreneurial opportunities in selected gender-sensitive value chains across seven countries in the Middle East and North Africa region. \nFor more information, please contact: \nMonica Carco, \nChief of Rural Entrepreneurship, Job Creation and Human Security \nEmail \nFor more details on the project ‘Promoting women’s empowerment (PWE) for inclusive and sustainable industrial development in the MENA region (Phase II)’, please click here . \n", "issueTime": "20 July 2020"},
