Photo by UNEPDuring a socially distanced ceremony in Oslo, Norway on 9 October, the Norwegian Nobel Committee recognized WFP for its “efforts to combat hunger (and) for its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas.”In 2019, WFP aided nearly 100 million people in 88 countries. The Nobel committee mentioned specifically its work in five war-torn states: Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, South Sudan and Burkina Faso.“Every one of the 690 million hungry people in the world today has the right to live peacefully and without hunger,” said WFP Executive Director David Beasley, in a statement.“Today, the Norwegian Nobel Committee has turned the global spotlight on them and on the devastating consequences of conflict.”Inger Andersen said “In many conflict zones, fighting has gone hand in hand with environmental degradation. In those places, restoring nature is vital for providing people with a solid foundation on which to rebuild their lives.”For example, in the arid Sudanese region of Darfur, where a brutal conflict has killed 300,000 people in the last 17 years, UNEP and WFP are working together to halt desertification, expand agricultural production and improve food security.  As part of that effort, the two organizations have helped plant 75,000 trees, train 1,584 households in water harvesting techniques, buttress the banks of seasonal rivers to prevent erosion of farmland, and build three major water spreading structures (weirs) that allow 4,500 families to cultivate vegetables and grains on 2,200 hectares of new productive land.Siel Gidiem village. Photo by UNEPWFP’s Nobel win comes amid what committee chairperson Berit Reiss-Andersen, called a “dramatic” rise in the number of people on the brink of starvation. An estimated 265 million people may face acute hunger by the end of the year as a result of wars, climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.    Reiss-Andersen called on countries to step up their commitments to the battle against hunger.“The world is in danger of experiencing a hunger crisis of inconceivable proportions if the World Food Programme and other food assistance organizations do not receive the financial support they have requested.”Amid rising populism in many countries, the committee pointedly said the award was meant to underline the importance of multilateralism and international bodies working to solve global problems.WFP is the seventh United Nations organization to earn the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize. Other laureates include: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, who won the award twice – in 1954 and 1981; UN Children’s Fund in 1965; International Labour Organization in 1969; UN Peacekeeping Forces in 1988; the International Atomic Energy Agency in 2005; the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007; and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2013. "},

{"title": "Thirty of the world’s largest investors set unprecedented 5-year portfolio decarbonization targets", "article": "Geneva, 13 October 2020 - Thirty of the world’s largest investors with $5 trillion assets under management have collectively agreed on concrete portfolio decarbonization targets that follow the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1.5 °C scenario for the next five years.UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance members will implement deep greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions in the 16% to 29% range by 2025 from 2019, amid likely rising global emissions in the same period.Published for public consultation, the 2025 Target Setting Protocol lays out plans for this substantial decoupling of asset owners’ portfolio GHG emissions from the global economy. The Protocol is integral to coherent and comprehensive plans to reduce emissions, increase investment in the net-zero emissions transition and enhance influence on markets and government policies.With this Protocol, Alliance members are sounding a very loud signal to the thousands of companies they own that deep emissions cuts are required. They will work with those willing to adjust their business models, and do not wish to engage in a divestment exercise. In order for their efforts to be met with success, substantial government action is required.In the first quarter of 2021, individual Alliance members will set their own portfolio targets from different starting points with respect to the level of carbon emissions currently contained within their portfolios. Several Alliance members will set large reduction targets, while others have already made substantial progress in their journey to net-zero, therefore the reductions required for their portfolios will be at the lower end of the range, while for some a lower 2025 target may reflect geographic or policy constraint that require them to decarbonize more slowly in early years.The Protocol was constructed to allow Alliance members to employ the combination of approaches that best supports their unique decarbonisation and engagement strategies and acknowledges their different carbon levels as of today. Each member is unique and as such may identify unique levers that exist within their institutions for accelerating decarbonisation. They also have different investment scopes, strategies, internal governance structures and levels of exposure to certain high-emitting sectorsIn this way the Alliance members aim to have “transparent, and unique” targets, which suit individual institutions, but which can also be aggregated such that progress for individual members and for the Alliance as a whole can be tracked and reported transparently. The first steps towards Alliance commitments are twofold: transitioning investment portfolios to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050; and achieving this through advocating for, and engaging on corporate action, as well as public policies, for the low-carbon transition of economic sectors in line with science and under consideration of social impacts. Defining net-zero pathways must take both goals into account, while also considering implications for a just transition.Engagement with portfolio companies is a core component to assure that not only the Alliance members’ portfolios transition to net-zero, but that the Alliance members also have an impact on the real economy. Although decarbonization of portfolios could be easily achieved by selling carbon intensive investments, it is highly questionable if such actions alone would have a positive impact on the real economy. Additionally, it might undermine Alliance members ability to engage with these corporate to effect reductions in the real economy.“Alliance members start out by changing themselves and then reach out to various companies to work on the change of their businesses” said Günther Thallinger, Alliance Chair and Member of the Board of Management, Allianz SE. “Reaching net-zero is not simply reducing emissions and carrying on with the business models of today. There are profound changes and opportunities that will come from the net-zero economy, we see new business opportunities and strong wins for those who are ready to lead,” he adds.Eric Usher, Head of UNEP FI, said: “According to the UNEP Emissions Gap Report, every year of postponed emissions peak means that deeper and faster cuts will be required. The Target-Setting Protocol represents world-leading progress on the required emissions reductions from some of the biggest investors in the world.”“Establishing firm interim portfolio decarbonization targets is key to meeting the Paris climate commitments. From a membership of 12 asset owners at launch over a year ago, to 30 and counting, means the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, a joint initiative of the PRI and UNEP FI, can have a huge impact on the way companies manage the carbon footprint of their operations” said Fiona Reynolds, CEO of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI).NOTES TO EDITORSAbout the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner AllianceConvened by UNEP FI and the Principles for Responsible Investment, we are an international group of 30 institutional investors (as of 8th October 2020) delivering on a bold commitment to transition our investment portfolios to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.

{"title": "The true costs of food systems and why they matter", "article": "World Food Day, which falls on 16 October, is an opportunity to reassess how humanity produces, distributes and consumes food. Are we doing those things in a sustainable way that benefits farmers, the environment and society at large? What is the impact of food systems on nature? Are we properly valuing biodiversity in agricultural areas?We put some of those questions to Salman Hussain. He is the coordinator of a six-year-old initiative from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) called the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) for Agriculture and Food. Its goal is to help countries understand the true cost of their food systems.UNEP: We hear a lot about the need to do agriculture differently. Why is this?Salman Hussain: Agriculture brings myriad positive and negative externalities, that is, costs or benefits that are externalized to third parties. Examples of negative externalities include the pollution of water bodies from nitrate leaching and human health impacts, such as pesticide poisoning. On the other hand, positive externalities from farming, such as community cohesion and the maintenance of livelihoods for smallholder farmers, are often undervalued. Some of these benefits simply do not get included in economic decision making. We need to account for positive and negative externalities otherwise we are not paying the true cost for our food.UNEP: What does TEEB do?SH: UNEP hosts TEEB, a global initiative focused on making nature’s values visible. TEEB for Agriculture and Food (also known as TEEBAgriFood) was launched in 2014 to make the dependencies and impacts that the agri-food value chain has on nature visible to decision makers. Our mission is to examine the true costs of agriculture.Photo: Unsplash/Annie Spratt UNEP: Are you involved in any country-based initiatives?SH: Yes. We have an International Climate Initiative-funded project in Colombia, Kenya, Tanzania and Thailand. The aim of the project is to catalyse policy reforms that integrate the often economically invisible values of biodiversity and ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes.Another European Union-funded project focuses on Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico and Thailand. It is seeking to make nature's values for food and farming visible and promote a sustainable food system that safeguards biodiversity and ecosystem services.UNEP: How has TEEB helped move the needle on sustainable agriculture recently?SH: An example is Indonesia, where the interim TEEBAgriFood report contributed to the inclusion – for the first time – of agroforestry in the [country’s] five-year development plan. What the Ministry of Planning found useful is that we made the economic case for agroforestry. We are now looking to build upon this inclusion in the development plan by working with stakeholders to develop viable scenarios for cacao agroforestry that support livelihoods as well as contribute to conservation outcomes.The TEEBAgriFood Framework we applied in Indonesia, which we are applying in all our country applications, won the World Future Council Vision Award in 2018.UNEP: Who else are you partnering with? SH: Recently TEEB has worked with the Global Alliance for the Future of Food and the Institute for the Development of Environmental-Economic Accounting to produce The TEEBAgriFood Evaluation Framework: Overarching Implementation Guidance. Launched on 29 September, it’s a step-by-step guide to assess how food systems impact people, society, the environment and natural resources. Supported by case studies, the guidance enables users to identify a range of actions that can transform how food systems operate and, simultaneously, helps to create a practical roadmap for action on biodiversity loss. For more information, please contact Salman Hussain: [email protected]"},
{"title": "Eating better - for us and the planet", "article": "Industrialized farming has been a reliable way to produce lots of food, at a relatively low cost. But it’s not the bargain it was once believed to be. Unsustainable agriculture can pollute water, air and soil; is a source of greenhouse gas; and destroys wildlife – an environmental cost equivalent to about US$3 trillion every year. The use of chemicals and antimicrobials can have adverse health effects and lead to resistant infections. And to top it all off, our production and consumption habits have been linked to the emergence of zoonotic diseases, such as COVID-19.To mark World Food Day on 16 October, we take a closer look at sustainable agriculture – how it can help reduce our environmental footprint, improve our health and even create jobs.What exactly is sustainable agriculture?It is farming that meets the needs of existing and future generations, while also ensuring profitability, environmental health and social and economic equity. It favours techniques that emulate nature–to preserve soil fertility, prevent water pollution and protect biodiversity. It is also a way to support the achievement of global objectives, like the Sustainable Development Goals and Zero Hunger.Does sustainable agriculture really make a difference to the environment?Yes. It uses up to 56 per cent less energy per unit of crops produced, creates 64 per cent fewer greenhouse gas emissions per hectare and supports greater levels of biodiversity than conventional farming.2019 Young Champion of the Earth for Asia and the Pacific, Louise Mabulo hopes to educate local farmers in the Philippines so that they can live a better quality of life. Photo: UNEPWhy does sustainably produced food seem more expensive?It may be more costly because it is more labour-intensive. It is often certified in a way that requires it to be separated from conventional foods during processing and transport. The costs associated with marketing and distribution of relatively small volumes of product are often comparatively high. And, sometimes, the supply of certain sustainably produced foods is limited.Why are some foods so much more affordable–even when they require processing and packaging?The heavy use of chemicals, medicines and genetic modification allows some foods to be produced cheaply and in reliably high volumes, so the retail price tag may be lower. But this is deceiving because it does not reflect the costs of environmental damage or the price of healthcare that is required to treat diet-related diseases. Ultra-processed foods are often high in energy and low in nutrients and may contribute to the development of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some forms of cancer. This is particularly concerning amid the COVID-19 pandemic; the disease is especially risky for those with pre-existing health problems.Do we all have to be vegan?No. But most of us should eat less animal protein. Livestock production is a major cause of climate change and in most parts of the world, people already consume more animal-sourced food than is healthy. But even small dietary shifts can have a positive impact. The average person consumes 100 grams of meat daily.  Reducing that by 10 grams could improve human health while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Is sustainable agriculture possible in developing countries?Yes. Because sustainably produced food is typically more labour-intensive than conventionally made food, it has the potential to create 30 per cent more jobs. And because it can command higher prices, it can also generate more money for farmers.Is it possible to make sustainably produced food that is affordable for everyone?Yes. As demand for certain foods increases, the costs associated with production, processing, distribution and marketing will drop, which should make them less expensive for consumers.  Policymakers can also play a role, facilitating market access and leveling the financial and regulatory playing field.Farmers in Shagra B area of Sudan's North Darfur State have been able to improve their livelihoods by selling produce at the local market. Photo: UNEPIf it is so important, why hasn’t sustainable farming been adopted as a global standard?There is a lack of understanding of the way that agriculture, the environment and human health intersect. Policymakers do not typically consider nature as a form of capital, so legislation is not designed to prevent pollution and other kinds of environmental degradation. And consumers may not realize how their dietary choices affect the environment or even their own health. In the absence of either legal obligations or consumer demand, there is little incentive for producers to change their approach.What are some ways to consume food more sustainably?Diversify your diet and cook more meals at home. Eat more plant-based foods; enjoy pulses, peas, beans and chickpeas as sources of protein. Eat local, seasonal foods. Purchase sustainably produced foods and learn more about farming practices and labeling. Avoid excessive packaging, which is likely to end up as landfill. Don’t waste food: eliminating food waste could reduce global carbon emissions by 8-10 per cent. Cultivate your own garden, even if it is a small one in your kitchen. Support organizations, policies and projects that promote sustainable food systems. And discuss the importance of healthy and sustainable foods with producers, vendors, policymakers, friends and family. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) supports a transition toward global food systems that provide net-positive impacts on nutrition, the environment and farmer livelihoods. Contributing to the One Planet Network Sustainable Food Systems Programme, UNEP has led the development of a guideline for collaborative policymaking and improved governance.UNEP is also the custodian of the food waste element of Sustainable Development Goal 12.3, which commits member states to halve their per capita food waste at the consumer retail level. Developing the Food Waste Index, UNEP is currently conducting global modelling of food waste data and preparing a harmonized methodology that will enable countries to track progress towards Goal 12.3.  For more information, contact Clementine O’Connor at: [email protected]"},
{"title": "Climate change: Proof in numbers", "article": "UNEP’s novel ‘World Environment Situation Room’ provides real-time data on PM2.5 levels across the planet, informing scientists, policy-makers and citizens alike.Last month, as wildfires continued to rage across the American West, Pascal Peduzzi, a climate scientist with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Geneva, followed the situation with air quality in Mammoth Lakes, a town high in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains.On Wednesday 23 September on the town’s Ranch Road the PM2.5 measurement – the tally of airborne particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometres – reached 501mg per cubic metre (µg/m3) of air. That is over 50 times the threshold that the World Health Organisation (WHO) considers safe for the average PM2.5 reading over one year. It is more than 20 times the level considered safe for a 24-hour period.“I’ve never seen it that high,” Peduzzi stated.The scientist was not in California, nor in the US. He was in Switzerland, over 9,000km away. Nonetheless, he, and anyone with an internet connection, can now follow in detail PM2.5 levels in the West Coast fire zone, and across the planet, via UNEP’s World Environment Situation Room (WESR). This online portal offers a near-real-time monitor of global air quality.\nPhoto by UNEP“The intention of this platform was to connect to people,” said Sean Khan, an expert on air pollution with UNEP in Nairobi. “It was designed to inspire and stimulate action, whether that’s communities trying to convince policymakers to do things or vice versa.”In August, following record-breaking high temperatures, lightning strikes from severe thunderstorms ignited fires in California, Oregon and Washington. By the end of September, these blazes had consumed over 2 million hectares of land across the three states. They had destroyed over 7,000 structures and left at least 40 people dead.“We now currently have five active fires that are five of the most destructive fires in the history of the state,” Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, said on 11 September, standing in smoky air among scorched trees.The fires threw fine particulate matter into the atmosphere. Alongside producing the extraordinary orange skies seen in television reports, studies have linked elevated PM2.5 levels with a range of health problems. These include asthma, respiratory inflammation, jeopardised lung function and even cancer.One study conducted for seven years (from 2000 to 2007) in the US indicated that average life span extends by 0.35 years for every 10 µg/m3 decrease in PM2.5. Another, which tracked 1.2 million American adults for 26 years from 1982 to 2008, found that the mortality of lung cancer increased by 15–27% when PM2.5 air concentrations increased by 10 µg/m3. “If you are someone with pulmonary complications, then you are vulnerable, you’ll be at risk,” Khan said. The WESR Air Portal includes a mobile app which offers weekly and daily hyperlocal forecasts in addition to user customised alerts for PM2.5.In the last 20 years, California experienced more years of drought – as classified on the US Drought Monitor’s (USDM) five-point scale – than it did without drought. The USDM gradings range from D0 – an area experiencing short-term dryness - up to D4, an area experiencing “exceptional and widespread crop and pasture losses, fire risk, and water shortages that result in water emergencies.”There were droughts between 2001 and 2005, 2007 and 2010, and from 2012 to 2017. These became more intense over time. The most severe period, between January 2014 and January 2017, led to a severe water deficit in both the soil and underground aquifers.“It’s definitely a shift in climate, it’s no longer a 10%, extreme event,” Pascal Peduzzi said. The changing climate also creates loop effects; warmer temperatures generate more evaporation, drying out soils and vegetation, in turn leaving them more susceptible to fire. The fires themselves, meanwhile, add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, alongside particulates, further contributing to climate change.  “If you have dry soils, and basically no precipitation, put a bit more wind on that and someone lighting a barbecue, and that’s it,” Peduzzi added. “It’s a recipe for disaster.”  The WESR platform is a collaboration between the UN and Swiss firm IQAir, which operates its own air quality monitoring platform.At maximum zoom-out, it shows a map of the planet, with arrows depicting wind patterns and air quality in particular areas represented by a shading system; green is good, yellow moderate, orange is unhealthy for sensitive groups.Red represents unhealthy conditions, while two shades of purple show very unhealthy and hazardous levels. Last Friday, 5,185,211,024 people, or 66.4% of the world’s population, were exposed to polluted air worse than WHO recommended limits. That figure updates every four hours.Zoom in and you come to circles containing numbers, at first average PM2.5 readings across a region and then down to individual sensors like that on Ranch Road in Mammoth Lakes. Flame icons show burning fires. By Friday the PM2.5 tally on Ranch Road had fallen to 32.8 µg/m3However, a mobile monitoring station in Pollock Pines, further north in the Sierra Nevada, was registering 706.4 µg/m3. The US wildfire season is not over yet."},
{"title": "No time to waste: using data to drive down food waste", "article": "Approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption gets lost or wasted – around 1.3 billion tonnes every year. This amounts to roughly US$680 billion in developed countries and US$310 billion in developing countries, with a carbon footprint of about 3.3 billion tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to 8 per cent of global greenhouse emissions.Cutting food waste is one of the most effective ways to reduce climate impact.However, lack of data has been pointed to as a major cause for inaction. “Everybody thinks they don’t waste food,” says Clementine O’Connor, Sustainable Food Systems Programme Officer at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). “Food waste data helps governments understand the scale of the problem at home, and make the case for action.” Data also helps countries and companies identify hotspots in the supply chain, evaluate the efficacy of policy measures, estimate the potential for material recovery and track progress towards 2030.How food waste data can support effective planningExisting global estimates rely on extrapolation of data from a small number of countries, often using old data. A better measurement may show that action on food waste prevention could benefit developing countries as well as developed ones. For example, a 2015 study in Ghana shows household food waste generation at 80-86kg per capita across regions, comparable with rates in New Zealand. Making up an average of 48 per cent of all municipal solid waste and 79 per cent of all organic waste in Ghana, food waste data can also reveal opportunities to reduce the burden on waste management systems through interventions to both prevent food waste and make better use of it through circular systems.In Chittagong, Bangladesh, household waste data shows that vegetable/food waste represents 62 per cent of all household solid waste. One study outlines how this can be “converted from burden to resource” through segregation at the source.UNEP together with expert partner WRAP will publish new global food waste estimates as part of the Food Waste Index report in early 2021.UNEP supports countries in setting food waste baselines, developing national food waste strategies and identifying scalable solutions to transition to healthier, more sustainable food systems.SDG 12.3 measures food loss and food waste with separate indicators:Together, the two indices help countries track progress on food loss and waste reduction across the supply chain, from production to consumption. New initiatives will help to disseminate these tools through regional working groups and pilot programmes at country and city level.GO4SDGs: regional solutions for more sustainable food systemsThe Global Opportunities for Sustainable Development Goals (GO4SDGs) initiative, launched last year by UNEP together with strategic partners, will address the lack of food waste data in the Global South, by providing capacity building on the Food Waste Index methodology, enabling coherent measurement and comparable data across countries, and facilitating regional collaboration on measurement issues, strategy development and food waste action.“The GO4SDGs project is designed to strengthen capacities and cooperation to deliver on the 2030 Agenda and Paris Agreement by helping countries, businesses and individuals chart pathways to more sustainable policies, practices and lifestyles,” says Adriana Zacarias Farah, UNEP’s Head and Global Coordinator of GO4SDGs. “Under the GO4SDGs initiative, regional working groups on food waste measurement will be set up in five regions to support countries in measuring their baselines. This is an essential element in developing national food waste strategies and making progress on halving food waste by 2030.\"The GO4SDGs’ Menu of Services offers a range of tools to reduce food waste and promote healthy diets, as well as to support the development of policies on climate change and food security. These include guidelines for prevention and reduction of food waste in key sectors, including restaurants and tourism, practical ways for individuals to reduce food waste, including through the #AnatomyofAction, and a range of training and capacity development opportunities on food systems transformation, organic food production and export, and more. To learn more about GO4SDGs, visit www.GO4SDGs.org."},
{"title": "Historic UN Summit on Biodiversity sets stage for a global movement toward a green recovery from COVID-19", "article": "New York, 30 September 2020 — Recognizing that the continued deterioration and degradation of the world’s natural ecosystems were having major impacts on the lives and livelihoods of people everywhere, world leaders called for increased resolve to protect biodiversity at the UN today.A record number of countries - nearly 150 countries and 72 Heads of State and Government -addressed the first ever Summit held on biodiversity to build political momentum towards the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, to be adopted at COP15 in Kunming, China next year.The Summit comes on the heels of the Leader’s Pledge on Monday, which saw 74 countries commit to preserving biodiversity, sending “a united signal to step up global ambition for biodiversity and to commit to matching our collective ambition for nature, climate and people with the scale of the crisis at hand.”“The degradation of local and regional ecosystems, unsustainable agricultural practices, and the exploitation of natural resources, are putting critical pressure on world ecosystems,” said President of the General Assembly Volkan Bozkir, who presided over the Summit. “Clearly, we must heed the lessons we have learned and respect the world in which we live.”He added, “A green recovery, with an emphasis on protecting biodiversity, can address these concerns, mitigate risks, and build a more sustainable, resilient world. Doing so can help unlock an estimated US$10 trillion in business opportunities, create 395 million jobs by 2030 and encourage a greener economy.”UN Secretary-General António Guterres said biodiversity and ecosystems are essential for human progress and prosperity. “By living in harmony with nature, we can avert the worst impacts of climate change and recharge biodiversity for the benefit of people and the planet.”“Let me be clear,” he added. “Degradation of nature is not purely an environmental issue. It spans economics, health, social justice and human rights. Neglecting our precious resources can exacerbate geopolitical tensions and conflicts. Yet, too often environmental health is overlooked or downplayed by other government sectors. This Summit is our opportunity to show the world that there is another way. We have to change course and transform our relationship with the natural world.”In addition to leaders, the Summit heard from HRH Prince Charles, who called for a new “Marshall Plan” or a “blue-green recovery’ and indigenous leaders who, as defenders of biodiversity, spoke about the need to allow indigenous people to use their traditional knowledge to preserve, protect and manage nature.UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen said the Summit showed a greater willingness to act.  “Today we have seen tremendous commitment to act, invest and drive action for a nature-positive world. We are seeing a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to moving conversations on biodiversity, beyond the environment corridors. We are seeing strong momentum towards sealing an ambitious and measurable agreement at the COP15 in Kunming. As we tackle three planetary crises – the nature crisis, the biodiversity crisis, and the pollution and waste crisis–such an Agreement is crucial to reversing the damage already done, and indeed to tackling the risks that lie ahead.”UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said: “This Summit has as much to do with people as it has to do with nature.  It is about people’s dependence on nature, people’s inabilities to see the complexity of nature, and people’s blindness, sometimes greed and ignorance, and the blind spot of economies and economics for so long to recognize the value of ecosystem services. We are coming to a point in history where there is growing awareness that action on biodiversity is inextricably linked with broader human development through the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda.’’NOTES TO EDITORSAbout the United Nations Summit on BiodiversityThe United Nations Summit on Biodiversity was be convened by the President of the General Assembly on 30 September 2020, at the level of Heads of State and Government under the theme of “Urgent action on biodiversity for sustainable development.”About the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)UNEP is the leading global voice on the environment.

The United Nations' reports are also raising alarm bells on the climate crisis and tipping points from which we may not be able to rehabilitate our planet’s ability to deliver life-supporting vital goods and services.To build knowledge on how nature functions to deliver goods and services to humanity, the United Nations Environment Programme's (UNEP) Wild for Life 2.0 campaign will bring users on an interactive journey to learn about 4 distinct ecosystems- marine, peatlands, savannas and forests -why they are crucial to human well-being, why they are under threat and what we can do to help.The latest journey features a unique ecosystem: The Peatlands, which filter fresh water, nurture medicinal plants, protect the land from floods and capture and store enormous quantities of carbon. Though peatlands cover only 3% of the planet’s surface, they store twice as much carbon than all the world’s forests combined!The setting for Wild for Life 2.0’s interactive Peatlands journey is globally significant peatlands such as the Peatland of Peninsula Mitre in the Southern Cone of South America. The Tierra del Fuego archipelago represents the southernmost part of the Magellanic peatland (moorland). The main island, Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, is divided between Chile in the west and Argentina in the east. Oceanic conditions and the SW wind direction prevail in southern Tierra del Fuego, where a west-east aligned mountain range dominates the landscape.UNEP speaks to its Patron for Protected Areas, Kristine Tompkins, and Oceans, Lewis Pugh about the importance of peatlands. Both have been to this remote part of the world and are on the front line of advocating for protected areas, through the Tompkins and Lewis Pugh Foundations.UNEP: Kristine, you’ve protected and rewilded millions of acres in Chile and Argentina. How were you originally inspired to do this?  Actually, in 1992 my husband Douglas Tompkins was the one who fully realized that we could participate in the global conservation movement by creating public-private conservation projects with the end result of establishing new national parks in Chile and Argentina.  So, one can say that I was inspired by my husband’s capacity to imagine creating large-scale permanently protected areas. Since we began, Tompkins Conservation has not stopped creating new parklands and rewilding these areas in both countries.UNEP:  Lewis you have advocated for marine protected areas in the Polar Regions. Why do you risk your life in this endeavour?I've spent over 30 years swimming in the oceans, and I have seen them change dramatically. The biggest changes have been in the Polar Regions where I’ve witnessed warming seas, retreating glaciers, melting permafrost and the disappearance of sea ice. These changes will impact every person and the whole of the animal kingdom. Climate change will accelerate rapidly if we don’t protect crucial ecosystems like peatlands, which capture so much carbon. I can’t just stand by and watch it unfold.UNEP: How did you come to know and love this remote area? Kristine:  When Douglas was training as a ski racer in the early 1960s in Chile and Argentina he got to know the Southern Cone fairly well. I followed in the early 1990s, and we both fell in love with the region, but more importantly, we saw that the diversity of landscapes, from the temperate rainforests of what's now Pumalin Douglas Tompkins National Park, to the expansive grasslands of Patagonia. More recently, in the face of severe climate change, we are focusing on the importance of peatlands, especially in Chilean and Argentine Tierra del Fuego. As an example of this, Peninsula Mitre, with almost 84% of Argentina's peatlands, is especially key as the most important carbon capture point in the country.  Lewis: Most of my Antarctic expeditions have left from Patagonia. So that’s where I do my final cold-water training. The Beagle Channel is the perfect place to train for a swim in Antarctica. The water is icy cold, but not so cold that it’s impossible to train. The Darwin icefield, whose glacial tips reach the sea level in the fiords of both the Beagle Channel and the Straits of Magellan, is located here.Every time I pass through Patagonia I tell myself I need to spend more time here, it is just so beautiful! I strongly support linking land and sea-based protected areas such as what is being proposed in the peatlands of the Peninsula Mitre.UNEP:  What is the standout moment in all you have done?Kristine: Oh, this is quite difficult to say!  Certainly, the final national park donations eighteen months ago in Chile, the largest conservation donation in history, has to stand as one of them, but we are fortunate to have met most of our large conservation goals over the last 28 years. I am always proud of our teams and the relationships we have forged with governments in every single case!Lewis: It would have to be helping to establish the Ross Sea Marine Protected Area in Antarctica. The swim I did there in 2015, to highlight the importance of protecting this sea, was my toughest ever – not to mention the coldest! Afterwards, I had to shuttle between various capitals for 2 years to get the final agreement approved. It was exhausting. But the Ross Sea is one of the most important ecosystems on the planet. At 1.5 million km2 the Ross Sea MPA is now the largestprotected area in the world. To put it in perspective, it’s the size of the UK, France, Germany and Italy combined.UNEP:  How can ordinary people find their own agency to make a transformational change?Kristine: The first, and perhaps most difficult step, is simply deciding to join in the movement to change our relationship to nature, and to form more healthy, dignified communities. Without this commitment, we will slide back down into inaction very quickly.As in all things in life, one has to commit to something and never let it go - in this case, get out of bed every single day and do something for those things you love, those things you hold to be true. There are millions of people who work in conservation and each and every one of us is ordinary, but we are committed to doing our part. We’re well past the point where doing nothing is acceptable!Lewis: It starts with becoming environmentally literate so that we understand the impact of our actions on the world around us. For example, every purchase you make is a decision about the future you want to leave for your children. The food we eat, the clothes we wear, the way we travel, the way we build and heat our homes – all have an impact.I think it is also important to spend time in nature. We only protect the things we love, and you can't help but love the natural world when you take the opportunity to witness how truly miraculous it is.UNEP:  What’s next on the horizon for your work?Kristine: We have many new projects underway protecting land and sea in Chile and Argentina and, of course, we have certain commitments to a few past projects that keep us busy as well.  We are often asked, “What will you do next?”, and I can tell you that the urgency of the climate crisis and the extinction crisis only grows every single day. We are propelled to work even faster, on a larger-scale and with greater determination than ever.Lewis: Right now, my team and I are focussed on helping build a network of marine protected areas around Antarctica, to protect the region from the kind of industrial overfishing that has decimated other oceans, and to help mitigate against the impacts of climate change.These protected areas will be in East Antarctica, the Weddell Sea and the Antarctic Peninsula. Together with the Ross Sea MPA, they will protect over 4 million km2 of vulnerable ocean. It will involve considerable work and diplomacy, as the 25 nations who govern Antarctica, all have to agree to it. But I am absolutely determined to help get the incredible part of the world properly protected."},
{"title": "Biodiversity takes center stage at the 75th session of UN General Assembly ", "article": "From action on climate, biodiversity, health, gender equality and more, world leaders, academics, young activists and others turned their attention to the United Nations in September with the need to work together for a sustainable future a common refrain.For the first time in the history of the annual event, global leaders were not able to meet in person for the General Assembly’s annual debate, but the 193-Member body’s President, Turkey’s Volkan Bozkir, said in his closing remarks that the COVID-19 pandemic “did not prevent multilateralism from operating at the highest levels.”“The pandemic has diverted resources and attention. But climate change, is still the greatest long-term threat to humanity,” he said, noting that as fires rage, sea-levels rise, and biodiversity is lost, there is even greater urgency in pursuing our climate goals and integrating them in our plans “to build back better from the pandemic.”Below is a recap from an environmental standpoint, with examples of how the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and issues on its agenda, were featured.75th Anniversary of the UNAn online timeline of environmental milestones highlights how UNEP has served as an authoritative advocate for the global environment since 1972, inspiring, informing and enabling nations and peoples to improve their quality of life without compromising that of future generations.UN Biodiversity SummitA record number of countries - nearly 150 countries and 72 Heads of State and Government - addressed the first ever Summit held on biodiversity to build political momentum towards the next meeting of the conference of parties for the Convention on Biodiversity (COP15) in Kunming, China next year.In his opening remarks, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres outlined three priorities for conserving and sustainably managing biodiversity:Senior UN officials, including UNEP’s Inger Andersen, took part in a fireside chat outlining what’s ahead for those working on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. Check out this live coverage of the summit from the UN News Centre, including dispatches from nominees for this year’s cohort of Young Champions of the Earth from Angola, Kenya and Saudi Arabia.Also featured at the event was the “Voices for Nature” segment highlighting initiatives and commitments for protecting the rich tapestry of life on planet earth.From reforestation to education about the impacts of and other efforts to restore biodiversity, world leaders and other attendees saw how games are, and will continue to be, key interactive ways to call attention to why it’s time to act now for nature. These gaming industry activations came to be thanks to the first-ever UNEP-supported #Playing for the Planet “Green Game Jam,” which took place earlier this year with Sony, Rovio, Pixelberry and other companies committing to integrate environmentally-themed storylines and missions into their games. With this important support, a potential 250 million people are being mobilized for sustainable development.The full summit may be watched online:Ahead of the summit political leaders from dozens of countries issued a pledge for nature, highlighting that the pandemic demonstrates the importance of the relationship between people and nature.Climate emergencyThe High-Level UN Climate Change Roundtable, featuring UN chief António Guterres, was designed to rally momentum for more ambitious action to limit global warming and to showcase the vast benefits or recovering from the pandemic in a sustainable way, that helps to limit global warming to 1.5C or lower.Also announced were plans for the UN and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to co-host a “landmark global event” on 12 December, the fifth anniversary of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. In 2021, the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) will be held in Glasgow.Nature for Life hubThis four-day online Nature for Life Hub, co-organized by the UN Development Programme, UNEP, and a number of other supporters, was billed as an opportunity to hear from political and corporate leaders, the world’s youth, indigenous and community leaders, local authorities and cutting-edge thinkers, leaders and practitioners. Speakers discussed these themes:For example, one session served as a preview for how an upcoming landmark UNEP report that will look at how to fix the climate, prevent a mass extinction and set a course for a sustainable future – all at the same time.Also featured at the hub were some of UNEP’s advocacy-related partnerships.Richard Vevers of The Ocean Agency discussed efforts to unlock the potential of creativity and big brand involvement in ocean conservation such as working with Adobe.Christian Thaller of Adidas Runtastic gave an overview of its current collaboration with UNEP: “Run Wild to protect biodiversity and wildlife,” which aims to engage 1 million runners, representing 1 million species threatened with extinction.Also, a group of youth leaders presented a manifesto and open letter on Tuesday calling for sustainability to underpin economic responses to the pandemic.Sustainable Development GoalsAs 2020 marks five years of work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, a number of events like the first “SDG Moment of the Decade of Action” touched on this ambitious agenda for people and planet, both progress made but also challenges ahead.This year’s edition of the SDG Media Zone focused on the power of science, solutions and solidarity—as seen through the vision of global leaders -- including Andersen and Convention on Biodiversity chief Elizabeth Mrema -- and experts at the forefront of global crises and efforts to recover better.Also taking part was newly-named UNEP Goodwill Ambassador chef Massimo Bottura who discussed global efforts to fight food waste.UNEP was also represented at the SDG Action Zone. Over the course of three days, the zone convened leading thinkers, actors, creators, and activists – including Andersen and Goodwill Ambassador Dia Mirza -- through frank debate, challenging discussions, inspiring showcases and creative experience. All sessions are available on-demand.Decade of Ecosystem RestorationAhead of the official 2021 launch of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration an online event gave a preview of what’s ahead for this important effort to revive the natural world that supports us all. Scientists say that these next ten years will count most in the fight to avert climate change and the loss of millions of species.Here are ten actions shared at the event and included in the newly-revealed strategy which aims to build a #GenerationRestoration.Principles for Responsible BankingTo mark the one-year anniversary of first-ever global sustainability framework for the banking industry, the UN Principles for Responsible Banking, a coalition of the signatories described their experiences as they have taken the first steps to far-reaching change."},

{"title": "Sudan launches first-ever State of the Environment and Outlook report to help guide peace and sustainable development", "article": "Khartoum, 7 October 2020 – The Government of Sudan and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) today jointly launched the first-ever State of the Environment and Outlook Report for the Republic of Sudan under the theme of Environment for Peace and Sustainable Development.This report’s launch comes as Sudan works to improve its political and economic systems to further economic and social progress following the country’s historical revolution and the 3 October 2020 signing of a peace agreement. Sudan’s efforts to rebuild present a fresh opportunity to ensure that environmental concerns are factored into the country's transition to freedom, justice, peace and growth.\"The theme of this report – Environment for Peace and Sustainable Development – is aptly chosen not only because it highlights the intricate nature of the nexus between environment, peace and sustainable development, but also because it comes at a time when the new Sudan seeks peaceful rebuilding of the nation, the establishment of a vibrant economy, and a politically stable future under the emblem of the December 2019 Revolution: Freedom, Peace, and Justice,\" said Prime Minister of Sudan Abdalla Hamdok. “Sudan aspires to utilise its rich natural resources for the welfare of its current and future generations.”The State of the Environment and Outlook Report comprises ten comprehensive chapters with facts and figures on the state and trend of the environment of Sudan from 2011 to 2020.  The report also contains an outlook section which provides an environmental vision to which the country can aspire in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  The report highlights the following needs: The report looks at Sudan’s specific environmental challenges in detail, covering a multitude of issues from deforestation and land degradation to waste management to food security. It provides detailed facts and figures collected from a broad spectrum of institutions, officials, experts and stakeholders.For instance, the report warns that an almost 30% population increase by the year 2030, will lead to a substantial rise in the number of people migrating from rural areas to cities in search of food, water, housing, and other services. This could add more pressure on Sudan’s natural resources, causing significant environmental consequences.The final chapter of the report explores policy options for a sustainable and peaceful future for Sudan. Two possible future scenarios depicted in the report – Business as Usual and Bending the Curve – demonstrate the differences between a future following the country’s current development path without intervention, and one following more sustainable environment conservation and better natural resources management.Some of the report’s policy options include:This report was produced under the UK-AID/UNEP Adapt for Environment and Climate Resilience in Sudan (ADAPT!) initiative, which aims to promote evidence-based policy and decision-making and scale up successful environmental practices in development and humanitarian programming.NOTES TO EDITORSAbout the UN Environment ProgrammeUNEP is the leading global voice on the environment.

{"title": "UNEP and the Parliament of the World’s Religions launch new book to catalyze climate action", "article": "Nairobi/Chicago, 8 October, 2020 – The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Parliament of the World’s Religions today released a new book, \"Faith for Earth — A Call for Action\", which gives readers a wide-ranging look at the history and diversity of faith teachings and their advocacy for the protection of the environment.The online book and its print edition were launched today during the Faith for Nature Global Conference, (5th - 8th October) in Skálhol, Iceland.The book provides a comprehensive overview of the faith traditions and scientific findings that underpin the understandings and reflections of world religions concerning environmental sustainability. It includes clear statements from sacred scripts and faith leaders.It underlines that protecting the Earth, restoring ecosystems, preventing pollution, and leaving behind a healthy environment for the next generations is an ethical, moral and spiritual responsibility. With more than one hundred million houses of worship around the globe, adapting green building principles is a massive demonstration of commitment to sustainability.“Our challenge is not that we don’t know what to do—it’s how quickly we can do it. We’re in a race against time that will require political will, innovation, inclusion, tolerance, values and ethics, financing, and partnerships,” Iyad Abumoghli, Director of UNEP’s Faith for Earth Initiative.“We’re calling on everyone – countries, cities, the private sector, individuals, and faith-based organizations to become part of the flourishing global interfaith movement that is increasingly bringing people together to protect and sustain life on Earth”, he added. “We hope the book will give people information and inspiration to learn more about our planet and become part of the flourishing global interfaith movement that is increasingly bringing people together to protect and sustain life on Earth.”“A majority of people today remain unfamiliar with religious teachings about valuing and caring for the natural world, especially teachings of traditions other than their own,” said Kusumita P. Pedersen, the book’s faith section author. “Faith for Earth can serve as a tool for increasing awareness, communication, and advocacy in both formal and informal ways.”David Hales, Chair of Climate Action at the Parliament and author of the book’s environmental section, considers that the decades ahead are a “crucible of moral choices.”“For half a century, we’ve known that the choices we make will have serious consequences for the world of the future and for our children and grandchildren,” he said.“We are the first generation in human history that has the opportunity to achieve sustainable and just societies,” he added. “To realize our opportunity, we have to choose responsibility — not just say we choose it — but commit to developing the capacity — at every level — to understand the material, physical, and moral consequences of the choices we make. Our choices will determine the future of the planet.”Faith for Earth was written and edited in consultation with dozens of faith leaders and religious scholars, and with scientific review from UNEP program directors, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and George Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication.The online edition of Faith for Earth is available as a free download at UNEP’s Faith for Earth website and through the Parliament’s Climate Action website, and includes links to scores of interactive features, resources, and real-time information about global environmental trends.Funding for Faith for Earth was provided by UNEP, the Thomas Berry Foundation, and Sikh Gurdwara San Jose, with additional support from individual donors.NOTES TO EDITORSAbout the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)UNEP is the leading global voice on the environment.

{"title": "Halving food waste and raising climate ambition: SDG 12.3 and the Paris Agreement", "article": "Food loss and waste generate an estimated 8 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions while using land and water resources needlessly and increasing pressure on biodiversity. Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 calls for a halving of food waste at retail and household level, and a reduction of food loss across the supply chain. Champions 12.3, a high-level coalition formed to deliver this strategic target, counts United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Executive Director Inger Andersen and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) US Board Member Yolanda Kakabadse among its Champions, and signatories of its September 2020 Global Call to Action on Food Loss and Waste.As we celebrate the first International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste on September 29th, UNEP talks to Yolanda, former President of WWF International, and former Ecuadorian Minister of Environment, about integrating food loss and waste in national climate strategies and the role of the youth in a shift towards sustainable food consumption.WWF US Board Member and former Ecuadorian Minister of Environment, Yolanda Kakabadse. Photo by WWFA new report developed by UNEP, WWF, EAT and Climate Focus, focuses on how food system interventions should be better integrated into national climate strategies, highlighting the 12.5 Gt CO2eq opportunity to tackle food waste and sustainable diets, which have been largely overlooked in previous Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement. How are Latin American governments considering this opportunity and how can they be supported?There are initiatives sponsored through the private sector, like Sin Desperdicio. These initiatives are important because they are encouraging public and private sector collaboration and showing value in better transparency and food loss waste target setting. Ultimately, each government needs to make the reduction of food loss and waste part of their NDC. It’s then imperative to see that the private sector and civil society are engaged and agreeing to publicly report food waste levels and set targets for reduction.What role does youth play in the fight against food waste? UNEP is developing lesson plans on food waste education with the Edible Schoolyard project in the context of International Day of Awareness on Food Loss and Waste. What are the best ways, in your experience, to inspire youth to develop sustainable food consumption behaviours?Strongly agree that we need to build environmental awareness into school curriculum planning with the youth. WWF-US has developed a Food Waste Warrior program which seeks to educate students on the connection between the food on their plate and the planet. The Food Waste Warrior program helps students understand the environmental impact of their food by conducting a food waste audit and experiment with ways to reduce food waste in their school. Most adults don’t contemplate the connection our food has on the planet and the impact it has on biodiversity. By making this connection in educational programs, we create a positive impact on the next generation of adults and accelerate change.COVID-19 has emphasized the need to build resilience in our food systems. How does WWF’s work to reduce food waste support a green recovery and a more resilient food future? COVID-19 has caused massive disruptions to national and global food systems. The reconfiguration in demand for commercial food service businesses has amplified inefficiencies in our supply chain. We also know that food insecurity is going to be a major problem globally, while some countries are sending edible food to landfill. We must declare 2020 the “Year of No Food Left Behind”. This can be done by improving transparency and by creating digital food inventories. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the lack of real-time data has led to an inability to locate and transport food from where it is, to where it is most needed. We must also expand our investments in developing countries on food banking and cold chain technologies.What priorities do you see for the coalition of food waste leaders, Champions 12.3, in the run-up to the UN Food Systems Summit?  For more information, contact Clementine O’Connor: [email protected]."},
{"title": "Rosewood conservation: a success story from Madagascar", "article": "For Madagascar farmer Edmond, who goes by one name, it was a breakthrough. In 2019 he perfected a complicated technique to grow a rare species of tree known as Dalbergia normandii.The plants hail from a valuable, and difficult-to-propagate family of trees known as rosewoods, which have been felled near to the point of extinction in many parts of Madagascar.“This year is one of the happiest years of my life because the time I spent on this technique was not in vain,” said Edmond, 60, who lives in Ambodimanga village on Madagascar’s eastern coast. \"This time, luck is with me.\"Edmond is working on a rosewood conservation project coordinated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Its aim is to safeguard a group of trees that is the world’s most trafficked wild product by value and volume. From Guatemala to Madagascar to Thailand to Zambia, rosewoods have been targeted by timber traffickers who seek to profit especially from its growing demand in China and Viet Nam, principally for furniture.Source: UNODC“Over the last decade, the share of total rosewood imports to China coming from Africa has steadily increased, with a portion of this share suspected to have been illegally sourced in or exported from Africa,” says a July 2020 report by the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC).  To help reverse this trend, in 2017 UNEP, Madagascar’s Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, and local partners launched a Global Environment Facility-funded project titled Conservation of key, threatened, endemic and economically valuable species. The project, which runs till 2022, seeks to reduce the threats to 21 economically important but threatened species at 18 sites in Madagascar. The production of large quantities of healthy new rosewood plants is critical to the project’s success.The Pointe à Larrée protected area, on the coast in central-eastern Madagascar, currently managed by Missouri Botanical Garden, is one of the project sites. It’s home to 13 species targeted by the project, including six species of Dalbergia, most of them rosewood. (All species of Dalbergia fall within the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species Appendix II.)Rosewood species “threatened for decades”“These species have been threatened for decades due to commercial exploitation for their very valuable `precious wood’ and habitat loss due to slash-and-burn cultivation,” says Adolphe Lehavana, project manager at Pointe à Larrée and an employee of Missouri Botanical Garden, an international non-governmental organization mandated by Madagascar to manage the protected area.“Population levels for some species are now critically low and they seemed doomed to local extinction since isolated trees fail to produce seeds.“For example, within the landscape, including the protected area, researchers have been able to locate just 10 remaining individuals of Dalbergia maritima and just one remaining individual of Dalbergia louvelii – all outside the protected area,” he adds.Through the project, resources are now being mobilized to prevent the local extinction of these very rare species by reinforcing the wild population as part of an ecological restoration programme.Edmond (right) and Nirina (left) are involved in a UNEP project to replant endangered rosewood trees in Madagascar. So far, the initiative has cultivated more than 2,000 saplings. Photo by Adolphe Lehavana/Missouri Botanical GardenIn 2019 the team produced 2,328 young rosewood plants using the technique developed by Edmond, the farmer. Known as air-layering, it allows conservationists to grow new roots from a plant’s branches which can then be deposited into the ground. The rosewoods have been used, with other native tree species, to enrich around 10 hectares of degraded forest. To date, the survival rate of young rosewoods has been nearly 100 per cent.The project contributes to the objectives of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework in Madagascar (2015-2019), providing vulnerable populations with employment opportunities and supporting sustainable development. It is also part of the broader effort to conserve biodiversity as set out in The Global Biodiversity Outlook 5, published by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.Through activities such as forest enrichment and restoration, the conservation of endemic species also contributes to Sustainable Development Goal 15, which aims to safeguard forests and protect biodiversity. The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030, led by the United Nations Environment Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and partners, covers terrestrial as well as coastal and marine ecosystems. A global call to action, it will draw together political support, scientific research and financial muscle to massively scale up restoration. Find out how you can contribute to the UN Decade.For more information, please contact Adamou Bouhari: [email protected]"},
{"title": "Celebrating African youth turning the tide on plastic pollution", "article": "Nairobi, 16 October 2020 – More than 400 young Africans were today honoured for their leadership in addressing plastic pollution in their communities as part of the Tide Turners Plastic Challenge. At a high-level event, political leaders, senior UN officials and Grammy-nominated Ghanaian musician Rocky Dawuni lauded the leadership shown by young people in global efforts to fight plastic pollution.The African Youth Summit – Tide Turners Plastic Challenge acknowledged the role of more than 400 champions who have completed all three levels of the Tide Turners Plastic Challenge Badge. Participants in the Challenge have shown leadership by raising awareness through social media, championing plastic waste collection campaigns and demonstrating sustainability in their own lives, among other things.Funded by the United Kingdom for the past two years, the Tide Turners Plastic Challenge has been completed by more than 225,000 young people in over 25 countries, including 50,000 in Africa. The challenge takes the participants on a learning journey consisting of three different levels: entry, leader, and champion.More than 1,500 young people attended the Summit, organised by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in partnership with the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, the World Organization of the Scout Movement and Junior Achievement Africa.The Summit which took place alongside the Scouts during their annual Jamboree on the Air and Jamboree on the Internet event (JOTA-JOTI) to share lessons from the actions young people have taken to fight plastic pollution and become environmental leaders in their communities. Six young changemakers shared their stories about how they went about provoking change and inspiring their peers to join them in taking action on plastic pollution.“The Tide Turners Plastic Challenge gave me a great platform to pass on the message against plastic waste and share my solutions,” said Fyona Seesurrun, a 22-year old student from Mauritius, one of the champions who was honoured at the summit.“100,000 mammals and one million birds die every year from eating or getting tangled in plastic in the ocean. If we do nothing, the amount of plastic in the ocean is set to treble by 2025. We must take collective action now. The Tide Turners are a force to be reckoned with, inspiring a whole new generation of leaders to tackle plastic pollution within their communities. That’s why the UK is supporting the UNEP to extend the work of the Tide Turners Plastic Challenge Badge to a further 20 countries around the world”, said Zac Goldsmith, UK Minister of State for Pacific and the Environment. Grammy-nominated Ghanaian musician Rocky Dawuni – a UNEP Goodwill Ambassador – also addressed the young people at the Summit and serenaded guests with hits including “Rock Your Soul”.The Tide Turners Plastic Challenge Badge is the first ever Scout and Girl Guide Badge made from recycled plastic; the Challenge has been integrated into a new digital platform for World Scouting’s new environmental education initiative: Earth Tribe, which unites 54 million Scouts in a global youth movement for the environment, and offers young people the opportunity to learn and act on key environmental issues that are affecting their communities.  In 2021, organisers will be adding a new element to the badge which will focus on influencing policy and practice change.Each year, more than 8 million tons of plastic ends up in the oceans, wreaking havoc on marine wildlife, fisheries, and tourism, and costing at least $8 billion in damage to marine ecosystems. World production of plastic materials in 2018 was estimated at 359 million tonnes and by 2040, the amount of plastic going into our oceans could triple.NOTES TO EDITORSThe Africa Tide Turners, 2020 is funded by the government of the UK and supported by the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM), World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), Junior Achievement, schools, and universities/colleges as well as the United Nations Environment Programme.Other participating partners are: Government entities such as the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) in Kenya, the Centre Ivorian Anti-Pollution (CIAPOL), the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NMASA), the Environmental Protection Agency of Sierra Leone, The Ghana National Plastic Action Partnership (NPAP) and The Blue Action Network (BAN).About the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)UNEP is the leading global voice on the environment.

{"title": "Agroecology – a contribution to food security? ", "article": "World Food Day on 16 October calls for global solidarity to help all populations, and especially the most vulnerable, to recover from COVID-19. We asked Marieta Sakalian, a food systems and biodiversity expert with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), why agroecology is relevant to this call. [UNEP] What is agroecology? [Marieta Sakalian] Agroecology is an ecological approach to agriculture, often described as low-external-input farming. Other terms such as regenerative agriculture or eco-agriculture are also used. Agroecology is not just a set of agricultural practices – it focuses on changing social relations, empowering farmers, adding value locally and privileging short value chains. It allows farmers to adapt to climate change, sustainably use and conserve natural resources and biodiversity.[UNEP] Why is conserving crop and animal diversity important for our health?[MS] We need to grow a variety of food to nourish people and sustain the planet, but over the last 100 years, more than 90 per cent of crop varieties have disappeared. Half of the breeds of many domestic animals have been lost. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), only nine plant species account for 66 per cent of total crop production, despite the fact that there are at least 30,000 edible plants.Losing diversity in our diets is directly linked to health risk factors, such as diabetes, obesity, and malnutrition. Developing and encouraging agroecological farming techniques can help make soils more productive, minimize the use of agrochemicals and pollution, and enhance crop diversity. This in turn can make agriculture more resilient.[UNEP] What has UNEP been doing to promote agroecology?[MS] In April 2018, FAO, supported by UNEP and other United Nations partners, launched the Scaling Up Agroecology Initiative, which works with food producers, governments and other stakeholders to promote agroecology. Globally, the initiative is demonstrating how agroecological systems are vital not only for addressing poverty, hunger, and climate change mitigation and adaptation but also for directly realizing 12 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals in areas such as health, education, gender, water, energy and economic growth. One successful example is the zero-budget natural farming project in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India, supported by UNEP.Photo by Axel Fassio/CIFORThe agroecology “movement” has been around for decades but it’s only in the past few years that it has gained international momentum. What has changed?[MS] The biodiversity and climate crises have renewed focus on agroecology, which adopts a more holistic, nature-based approach to agriculture. Agriculture is responsible for about 20 per cent of global greenhouse gases – we need to find different approaches to how we produce food, if we are to meet our climate goals. Species losses have also been unprecedented over the past 50 years. This has prompted a growing awareness, for example, of the economic value of pollinators – not just bees, but a whole host of other animals. Attitudes to the way we do farming are changing, and COVID-19 may be speeding up the process.[UNEP] Why is this approach relevant to food security? [MS] By 2050, our planet will need to feed close to 10 billion people. It is vital that we transform our agricultural and food systems so they work with and not against nature. As more people go hungry and malnutrition persists, we need to transform the way we do agriculture to achieve Zero Hunger by 2030. Agroecology focuses on ecosystem-based approaches which can galvanize agricultural production systems while helping to boost human well-being, tackle climate change and protect our living planet. But, for agroecology to be adopted at scale, it would need strong backing from policymakers.[UNEP] What are the challenges in implementing an agroecological approach to farming across the world?[MS] Education and finance are hurdles. In some countries, awareness of the benefits of this approach is limited and many farmers are conservative: having invested in machinery to do agriculture in a certain way they may be reluctant to change – especially without financial incentives. Read more about UNEP’s work on agriculture, biodiversity and food security:  The United Nations Environment Assembly resolution, Innovation on biodiversity and land degradation, encourages Member States to step up their efforts to prevent the loss of biological diversity and the degradation of land and soil.

{"title": "Mercury monitoring in Myanmar gets a boost", "article": "Across Myanmar, artisanal miners hunt for gold flecks in rivers and pit mines. The work is physically taxing and the income meagre. For many, the sprinkling of particles they find will only offer a few extra dollars of daily income.It is also dangerous. Mercury is widely used to recover small pieces of gold in soil and sediment – it combines with the gold to form an amalgam that is more easily extracted. But the mercury is poisonous. Miners can inhale vapor from mercury burning or ingest the heavy metal as they eat fish contaminated with mercury runoff. Adverse effects from exposure including kidney and autoimmune dysfunction, and neurological deterioration.An estimated 173,375 people work in Myanmar’s artisanal and small-scale gold mining sector, with actual figures likely to be higher. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has been working with the Government of Myanmar to reduce the impact of mercury on artisanal miners. Part of this support is building Myanmar’s capacity to ratify and implement the Minamata Convention on Mercury, a multilateral environmental agreement that aims to protect human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds.The year 2020 is a milestone for the Minamata Convention. It represents the deadline for phasing out the manufacture, import and export of many mercury-containing products listed in the Convention.Efforts are ongoing to develop an assessment of where Myanmar stands with regards to the provisions of the Convention. UNEP is also supporting Myanmar’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation (MONREC) on developing a National Action Plan to reduce and eventually eliminate mercury use in artisanal and small-scale gold mining.Conducting the assessment and monitoring compliance with existing regulations requires special equipment. In particular, a mercury meter, an expensive piece of technology, was vital to ensuring MONREC had the capacity to conduct surveys properly. To solve this problem, UNEP, in collaboration with the Japan Association for UNEP, facilitated the donation of a mercury meter to the Government of Myanmar from technology company CASIO Japan, which is supporting UNEP’s mercury regulation activities.Photo by UNEP“Anthropogenic mercury emissions are bad for human health and for the environment,” said Kakuko Nagatani-Yoshida, UNEP’s Regional Coordinator for Chemicals, Waste and Air Quality in Asia and the Pacific. “In Myanmar, we can make a big difference by improving capacity for mercury monitoring and detection. This contribution from CASIO will help greatly this regard.”The EMP-3 Portable Mercury Survey Meter is a compact, lightweight and reliable portable mercury analyzer, which normally retails for around US$11,000. Environmental monitoring teams deployed by MONREC will use the new machine to detect mercury in their field surveys. “The mercury survey meter will help us not only for mercury-contaminated site assessments in Myanmar but also for environmental quality monitoring activities of Environmental Conservation Department,” said Hla Maung Thein, Director General of MONREC’s Environmental Conservation DepartmentA 2015 study in Myanmar found that miners had more than twice the amount of mercury in their body compared to non-miners. For a sector so widely afflicted, the new monitoring capacity will be a welcome safeguard for the health of tens of thousands."},
{"title": "New UNEP report lights the way for financial institutions to shift to more sustainable circular economies", "article": "Geneva, 13 October 2020 – Financiers can and must make the shift to circularity, ensuring the consumption and production patterns of the businesses they invest in make more efficient use of resources and minimize waste, pollution and carbon emissions, according to a new report by the UN Environment Programme’s Finance Initiative (UNEP FI).Launched today at UNEP FI’s Global Roundtable 2020, Financing Circularity: Demystifying Finance for the Circular Economy outlines how financial institutions can help redesign global economies by changing the way we consume and produce.The move to circular economies could generate USD 4.5 trillion in annual economic output by 2030 while helping to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, protect the health of our ecosystems and enable sustainable recovery in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Banks, insurers and investors can play a critical role by providing businesses with financial products that contribute to the circular economy, conserve natural resources and avoid or reduce waste. Financial institutions currently lack awareness of circularity as well as the expertise, products and services to harness business opportunities.“The economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity to stimulate the urgent transition to more sustainable consumption and production. We need both the private and public sectors to transform our economies to address climate change, reduce pollution and improve resource efficiency. Collective action is critical to delivering on the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. “The financial sector and policymakers in particular have a central role to play in the shift from linear, wasteful growth to embedding circularity in finance and our economies.”The growth of circular business models will require structural and technological change, including innovation in the design and manufacturing of products and services; reducing inputs to agriculture; cutting food waste and using digital technologies to increase transparency and sustainability in supply chains. The financial institutions surveyed for the report recognized that there are opportunities to boost circularity in the buildings and construction, food and agriculture, chemicals and electronics sectors in particular. The report explores transitions already underway in these sectors, as well as in manufacturing, apparel and fashion, mining and energy and cross-cutting innovation in areas such as digital technology.It outlines a number of recommendations for financial institutions to boost circularity:The report highlights examples of innovation in financing circularity, including a sustainability bond issued by Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo, in collaboration with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, to fund projects and businesses under a €5 billion credit facility. It will support circular economy opportunities such as offering solutions for the lifetime extension of goods and materials, regeneration of natural capital (e.g. restoration of degraded soils), circular design focused on waste and pollution reduction, production processes producing or dependent on recycled resources, resource efficiency in the supply chain, reverse logistics, collection, separation and recycling of used materials and innovative technologies to enable circular business models.Swedish Insurance Fintech Omocon has developed a microinsurance product for the sharing economy, involving shareable goods rented out on a platform. The product protects the owner of a shareable good or asset that needs protection against damage. Omocom collects data on the sharing platform to look into the usage statistics of sharing transactions to calculate risk and price insurance. This has changed the underwriting process and claims processes.The report also identifies the need for governments to provide the financial sector with incentives and an enabling policy and legislative framework to accelerate the integration of circularity into financial products and services. Recommendations for policymakers, financial industry regulators and supervisors to address barriers and stimulate opportunities include: integrating measures to catalyze a just transition to a circular economy into climate policies, rules and regulations, implementing COVID-19 recovery strategies that embed circularity in economic growth and focus on a resilient and inclusive recovery, and implementing policies, laws and related instruments to address systemic barriers to circularity and create incentives.\n NOTES TO EDITORS About UN Environment Programme Finance InitiativeUnited Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) is a partnership between UNEP and the global financial sector to mobilize private sector finance for sustainable development.

{"title": "UNEP appoints renowned Italian chef and food system activist Massimo Bottura as Goodwill Ambassador", "article": "New York/Nairobi, 29 September 2020 – The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) today appointed renowned Italian chef Massimo Bottura as its newest Goodwill Ambassador, in a move designed to step up the fight against the global problem of food waste and loss.Bottura is chef patron of the three-Michelin-star restaurant, Osteria Francescana in Modena, and has been recognized as a social entrepreneur for his commitment to the fight against food waste and social isolation, which is one of the main goals of the non-profit organization he founded with his wife Lara Gilmore, Food for Soul. During the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy, his family produced an online cooking show called Kitchen Quarantine, which encouraged people to see the invisible potential in every ingredient, an invitation to enjoy the unexpected beauty in daily life.His appointment, on the inaugural International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste, is expected to catalyze action on an issue that not only sees food wasted in a world where over 800 million people go hungry every year, but contributes to the climate and biodiversity crises.“If we can use all of the ingredients to the fullest potential, we will reduce the amount of waste we are creating and shop more efficiently,” Bottura added. “In my role as UNEP Goodwill Ambassador, I will fight to reduce this global shame.”He noted that we all must start asking and understanding where our food comes from, taking action to preserve food memories and techniques that can help us innovate for the future and take care not to repeat practices and consumption behaviors that have caused the challenges in our food system today. He adds that the act of cooking – as well as that of feeding oneself – must become an ethical choice, not just a question of taste.An estimated one-third of all food produced – about 1.3 billion tonnes – is wasted or lost each year. About 14 per cent (of food global and as much as 40% in some markets) spoils before it even reaches retailers, as a result of market connection problems and lack of sustainable cold chains – the refrigeration systems that keep food fresh after harvest and in transit.Food loss and waste generates eight per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Cutting it back is one of the most effective ways through which individuals, businesses and governments can reduce their climate impact. The production of food that ends in waste requires land larger than the surface area of China and India combined, and water resources three times greater than the volume of Lake Leman. The unnecessary use of these resources has immense negative impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity.“There is no room for food loss and waste, especially as millions across the world go hungry,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP. “The pandemic is a wake-up call reminding us of the urgent need to transform our relationship with nature, and in particular, rethink the way we produce and consume food. I am delighted that Massimo Bottura, who is already making a difference through his Refettorios, is joining forces with UNEP to help bring real change.”Reducing food waste is a priority for Food for Soul, with its Refettorio projects around the world. From Milan, to Rio de Janeiro, Mexico and Paris, Food for Soul has saved over 125 tonnes, 175K pounds of imperfect food surplus from landfill, transforming ingredients into over a half million nourishing meals for those experiencing social isolation and vulnerability. Bottura wants to inspire further action on food waste across society by showing the value of food, its connection to culture, emotion and innovation.The International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste is a day to expand our consciousness and understanding of food loss and waste, by taking action with simple steps in cooking, preparing and storing that will not only make a difference in our homes but across our communities.We can all be part of the solution for a more sustainable future and must remember our social responsibility to both the planet and humanity.In addition to helping countries and companies measure and reduce food waste, and promoting behaviour change for sustainable food consumption, UNEP supports farmers and rural communities thanks to initiatives like the African Centre of Excellence for sustainable cooling and cold chain in Rwanda.Food waste will also be one of the key priority areas of the 2021 UN Secretary-General António Guterres a Food Systems Summit.Collaborating with people from a variety of cultures and backgrounds, we can multiply our contribution and have a greater impact. Massimo Bottura’s Goodwill Ambassadorship is intended to send a message to inspire a change of mindset that starts at home, in our kitchens.NOTES TO EDITORSAbout the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)UNEP is the leading global voice on the environment.

{"title": "Don’t ignore economic lessons of the Great Recession: new UNEP report", "article": "“The world today finds itself in the worst financial and economic crisis in generations. The crisis has triggered an unprecedented policy response: interest rates have been dramatically reduced, in some cases down to almost zero, and hundreds of billions of dollars in liquidity support and fresh capital have been provided to banking systems around the world.”Sound familiar? This is what economist Ed Barbier said in 2008-09 with the world reeling from the effects of the financial crisis. At the time, experts urged countries to put environmental sustainability at the core of their recovery packages, a message that received a lukewarm response.Now, more than a decade later, a new report from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) says the world has a second – and possibly last – chance to tackle climate change and other environmental threats. Authored by Barbier, a professor at America’s Colorado State University, it draws on lessons from the Great Recession and calls on governments to develop concrete strategies to combat environmental decline as they rebuild their economies from COVID-19. The paper, Building a Greener Recovery: Lessons from the Great Recession, is the first in a series of UNEP reports designed to help countries build back more sustainably from the pandemic.The paper finds that in the wake of the financial crisis, some countries made investments in energy efficiency and clean energy projects. Those efforts created jobs and expanded the use of renewable energy for several years but provided little long-term support for de-carbonizing the world economy.This time, the paper calls on governments to commit to a five- to 10-year strategy of public investment and legislative reforms, including implementing levies that would make it more expensive to pollute. It says that will help spur a transformation towards a green economic order and foster a sustained financial recovery.The paper also suggested differing legislative approaches in developed and developing countries. For low- and middle-income states, many of which are under extreme fiscal pressure because of the pandemic, the report recommended:The world has much catching up to do when it comes to climate change, according to UNEP Emissions Gap reports. Had serious climate action begun in 2010, the planet would have had to reduce emissions by 3.3 per cent per year to avoid a 1.5°C rise in global temperatures, considered a red line for the environment. However, since this did not happen, it will need to slash emissions by 7.6 per cent annually.The working paper was launched on the opening day of the UNEP Finance Initiative’s biennial Global Roundtable. For more information, please contact: Laila Saada ([email protected]) "},
{"title": "With “Earthshots”, Prince William takes aim at environmental decline", "article": "Prince William launched a new global award for the environment today designed to help address some of the planet’s most pressing challenges, from pollution to climate change. The Earthshot Prize will provide over £50 million to support ground-breaking solutions to environmental problems over the next 10 years – a critical decade for the Earth, say experts.“The plan is to really galvanize and bring together the best minds, the best possible solutions, to fixing and tackling some of the world’s greatest environmental challenges,” says Prince William, second in line to the British throne. “We’ve got to harness our ingenuity and our ability to invent. The next 10 years are a critical decade for change.”The Earthshot Prize draws inspiration from American President John F. Kennedy’s so-called Moonshot, the drive to put man on the moon in the 1960s. That effort sparked the imaginations of millions of people while simultaneously spearheading the development of new technology. The Earthshot Prize pivots around five “Earthshots” – clear, ambitious goals for the planet which, if achieved by 2030, will improve life on earth for generations to come, say organizers. The five Earthshots unveiled today were: protect and restore nature; clean our air; revive our oceans; build a waste-free world; fix our climate.The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is part of a global coalition that has been established to maximize the impact of the Earthshot Prize – a coalition that includes the World Economic Forum, World Wildlife Fund, The Green Belt Movement, Greenpeace and Conservation International.“We are in the midst of three concurrent planetary crises. Driven by our unsustainable consumption and production, the climate crisis, the nature crisis, and the pollution and waste crisis have been underway for decades,” says UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen.  “But in this decade that will define how we live on the planet, we need inspiration, solutions and solidarity like never before. UNEP is proud to support the Earthshot Prize, which aims to find and highlight solutions to the world’s greatest challenges, so that we may together restore the earth on which we all depend.”Organizers say the prize aims to counter the pessimism surrounding the state of the planet and scale up innovative, evidence-based ideas that make the Earth healthier. Each Earthshot is pegged to scientifically agreed targets underpinned by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the world’s blueprint for a better future. They also support the UN Decade of Action, a global push to realize the SDGs and dovetail with another major UNEP honour, the Champions of the Earth Award.Every year from 2021 until 2030, Prince William, alongside the Earthshot Prize Council, will name five prize winners, one per Earthshot. The prize includes £1 million, which will support environmental and conservation projects that are agreed with the winners – as well as a global platform to showcase their stories of hope and change over the decade, with the ambition that their solutions are mainstreamed, replicated and scaled.The prize – which is open to individuals, communities, countries, businesses and not-for-profit organizations– will open on 1 November 2020. More than 100 Earthshot partners from around the world are invited to submit nominations. A distinguished panel of experts, including the Director of UNEP’s Europe Office, Bruno Pozzi, will support the judging process, making recommendations to the Prize Council, who will select one winner from each category.In addition to the Prize Council, the Earthshot Prize will be supported by a Global Alliance, a network of philanthropists, organizations and companies which share the ambition of the Earthshot Prize to repair the planet."},
{"title": "Every last bit: how Unilever is helping consumers say no to food waste", "article": "An estimated one-third of food produced globally is lost or wasted from farm to table. This is about 1.3 billion tonnes of food – an amount that would occupy more land surface area than China and India combined.  Instead of feeding people, it affects ecosystems and biodiversity, generating eight per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 calls for a halving of food waste at the retail and household level, and a reduction of food loss across the supply chain. Champions 12.3 - a high-level coalition formed to deliver this target - counts UN Environment Programme (UNEP) Executive Director Inger Andersen and Unilever Chief Executive Officer Alan Jope among its Champions, and signatories of its September 2020 Global Call to Action on Food Loss and Waste.As the world marks the first International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste, UNEP Programme talks to Alan Jope about integrating food loss and waste in corporate climate strategy and the role of the private sector in helping consumers to reduce food waste at home.Alan Jope, Unilever Chief Executive Officer. Photo by UnileverIn June 2020, Unilever announced new commitments and actions to fight climate change and regenerate nature. What part does food waste play in Unilever’s strategy to mainstream sustainable living? When you are in the foods business and know that one third of all food is lost or wasted you can’t ignore it. Even more so when your purpose is to make sustainable living commonplace!Hanneke Faber, our President for Foods & Refreshment, has therefore made tackling food loss and waste central to our Foods business strategy. She recognizes that tackling this one issue has multiple benefits. It means increased production capacity whilst using fewer natural resources, it means less greenhouse gases emissions and it means cost savings for everyone. It is an issue where ‘the system’ comes to life – a triple win for food security, climate, and people’s wallets.Addressing food loss and waste starts with getting our own house in order by reducing food waste in our own operations. We have longstanding zero waste to landfill programs in place and recently we announced our commitment to halve food loss and waste in our global direct operations by 2030, as part of the Champions 12.3 initiative.Then you must think about who you can influence – encouraging your partners across your value chain to address the issue and your consumers who enjoy your products. With our marketing and behaviour change skills we want to encourage consumers to be more creative with their food and waste less; this is an area where we believe we can have a big impact.And now is the time to really go after this. COVID-19 is a nightmare, but it has reawakened people to the value of food. A perfect opportunity to start a consumer-focused movement and accelerate progress towards achieving SDG 12.3.Sustainable Development Goal 12.3 asks governments to halve retail and consumer food waste and reduce food loss by 2030. Yet so far very few countries have baseline data against which they can track their progress. Is Unilever working to collect food waste data in its operations? How can the private sector support governments with data collection in manufacturing and retail?It’s a cliché, but what gets measured gets managed.When we committed to halving food loss and waste in our global direct operations by 2030, as part of the Champions 12.3 10x20x30 initiative, we spent a good amount of time making sure we could collect the data we needed. And it is tricky. I can understand why governments struggle.The Target-Measure-Act approach from Champions 12.3 helped us on that journey. Setting out a high-level ambition is motivating to me, and it certainly motivated our teams to work through the challenges we had.Unilever has adopted the Food Loss and Waste Accounting and Reporting Standard, which helps to drive greater transparency and accountability in the collection and reporting of data. That helps governments report on the progress of SDG 12.3 and it helps to keep us honest: comparability and transparency of data mean there is no hiding if we are not delivering!Unilever piloted a unique food waste reduction campaign in Brazil. Can you tell us about the inspiration for the campaign and how Brazilians responded to it? One of my favorite meals is my wife’s chicken soup, which is made from leftover roast chicken. The soup is better than the main event! I am telling you this because as a manufacturing and marketing business we spend a huge amount of time understanding what consumers think and do.Hellmann’s – our global dressings brand – has used consumer insights, combined with the knowledge that as much as 45 per cent of all food waste happens in homes, to encourage people to use their leftovers to create another fantastic meal. Hellmann’s has already reached more than 100 million people over the last two years with its campaigns in Brazil and other countries, working with several NGO and media partners to educate, inspire and enable consumers to be more resourceful with their food.Most people are not aware of the extent of the food waste issue and rarely make the connection of throwing away food with climate change and food security. Hellmann’s believes food is too good to be wasted which is why they are trying to raise awareness about the impacts of food waste and to inspire and enable people to waste less.Data suggests household food waste has been decreasing under COVID-19-related lockdowns. Has this unique moment created new opportunities for Unilever to address food waste? How would you advise other companies to use their influence on consumer behaviour to reduce food waste at home?Wasting food is not a behaviour; no one sets out to do it. It is the outcome of a complex chain of behaviours from meal planning, shopping, storage to cooking and serving, which can all contribute to food ending up in the bin.When we spent more time at home, and when trips to the shops or deliveries were scarcer, we naturally put more thought into our shopping, storage and many had more time to cook from scratch producing less waste. But it also had the reverse effect of making some people overbuy and waste more!There is a huge opportunity to use this moment as a catalyst for lasting change, not least as research shows many people intend to continue new habits started during lockdown. But with food easier to access and life returning to some sort of normal, it is very easy to fall back into old habits.Changing habits and behaviour is never easy. There is a gap between people wanting to reduce food waste and people having the information, skills, and tools they need to act. We are keen to help close that gap.Hellmann’s is therefore extending its effort to save food from being wasted around the world by rolling out its education and inspiration campaigns across North America and Europe. We are also looking to further strengthen this initiative with input from behavioural psychologists and academics to help embed behavioural changes so food waste becomes a thing of the past.I am keen for companies and non-governmental organizations to join us in driving this behaviour change. At the Champions 12.3 session In September, I encouraged the members to come together and start a consumer movement with new social norms and lots of practical help to shop food better, store it better and use food better, in order create the triple win for the climate, food security and people’s wallets. For more information, contact: Clementine O’Connor ([email protected])Champions 12.3 is a coalition of executives from governments, businesses, international organizations, research institutions, farmer groups, and civil society dedicated to inspiring and mobilizing ambition toward Sustainable Development Goal Target 12.3, by 2030.

{"title": "Afghanistan and Tajikistan step up environmental cooperation ", "article": "Dushanbe/Kabul, 24 September 2020 - The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Republic of Tajikistan have taken an important step in strengthening joint efforts to protect their unique, shared mountain ecosystem of the Panj Amu Darya river basin with the signing of the two nations’ first-ever bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on environmental protection.The agreement, which was signed in Dushanbe on 17 September 2020 and has a five-year duration, focuses on five key areas: climate change adaptation; biodiversity conservation; monitoring of water quality; environmental assessment and sharing of knowledge and expertise on ecosystem management. It also includes a commitment by the two countries to undertake environmental impact assessments of joint projects and to notify each other in case of potential environmental impacts across borders.“It gives us great pleasure to welcome our friends and neighbours from Afghanistan in Dushanbe to conclude today’s important agreement and join our hands in conserving the outstanding wildlife of our shared mountain ecosystems and help our peoples adapt to the growing impacts of climate change,” said Sheralizoda Ahmadjon, Chairman of the Committee on Environmental Protection of Tajikistan.The spectacular landscape of the Pamir and Wakhan mountains, whose glaciers give rise to the Amu Darya – Central Asia’s largest river – is home to iconic species including the endangered snow leopard, mountain goats and sheep, and endemic vegetation communities.With the ranges’ strategic location at the crossroads of the historic Silk Road, the new agreement seeks to solidify the alliance between the two countries in protecting the fragile mountain ecosystem by mitigating the environmental impacts of future investment plans in infrastructure, extractives and trade, as well as supporting local communities in adapting to climate change through sustainable natural resource management practices.Discussions between the two countries first took place in 2012 under the auspices of the UN Economic Commission for Europe, which led to the endorsement of an MoU on the exchange of hydrological data for the Panj-Amu Darya in 2014. This MOU has enabled the installation of hydrological stations along the over 1,000-kilometre-long shared river border between the two countries, and the exchange of water flow data. This data is critical not only for water resources management and climate adaptation, but also for flood and drought forecasting and early warning systems.    The conclusion of a new environmental cooperation MOU represents the second major milestone of this bilateral dialogue process, which UNEP helped facilitate, supported by the European Union, under the Opportunities for Mountain Area Integrated Development project.“The agreement provides a structured framework for Afghanistan and Tajikistan to practically address the threats of climate change and biodiversity loss. We hope this cooperation will continue to extend to the other countries of the Amu Darya basin in the future,” said Gary Lewis, Director of UNEP’s Disasters and Conflicts Programme.The MoU also fulfils the commitments made by the two countries under the Protocol of the 7th Meeting of the Intergovernmental Economic, Commercial, Social and Technical Commission (July 2019) to expand their cooperation efforts to protect and sustainably manage their natural resources.Zoi Environment Network – a non-governmental organisation based in Switzerland - also contributed to the organization of meetings and has been a long-standing partner in the Afghan-Tajik cooperation process.  The new agreement also establishes a Technical Working Group on environmental protection responsible for development and implementation of cooperative programmes and activities.One of the first activities under the new agreement is a study tour for environmental experts from both countries to survey the environmental challenges in the Panj basin – Pamir Mountains region – and to develop a joint environmental action plan. To facilitate knowledge exchange, UNEP is also supporting both countries in developing a geospatial platform to exchange environmental information.NOTES TO EDITORSSee the Visual Atlas of CooperationAbout the UN Environment ProgrammeUNEP is the leading global voice on the environment.

{"title": "Food loss and waste must be reduced for greater food security and environmental sustainability ", "article": "Rome/Nairobi/New York , 29 September 2020 – At the global event marking today the first International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and their partners urged everyone to do more to reduce food loss and waste or risk an even greater drop in food security and natural resources.Some 690 million people today are hungry and three billion cannot afford a healthy diet. Hunger has been on the rise for the past five years, and the COVID-19 pandemic is threatening the food and nutrition security of up to an additional 132 million of people. On top of that, we are faced with an ecosystem decline and the consequences of climate change.Yet, food continues to be lost and wasted. This year we have witnessed an increase in food loss and waste as a result of movement and transport restrictions due to the pandemic.COVID-19 aside, however, each year about 14 percent of the world’s food is lost before even reaching the market. Food loss is valued at $400 billion annually – about the GDP of Austria. On top of this comes food waste, for which new estimates are coming out early 2021. When it comes to environmental impact, food loss and waste generate eight percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.Food loss occurs from farm up to and excluding retail, whilst food waste occurs at retail, food service and household level. Causes range from poor handling, inadequate transport or storage, lack of cold chain capacity, extreme weather conditions to cosmetic standards, and a lack of planning and cooking skills among consumers.Simply put, reducing food lost or wasted means more food for all, less greenhouse gas emissions, less pressure on environment, and increased productivity and economic growth.  Innovation, technologies and behavioral change – key to reducing food loss and waste “Food loss and waste is a big challenge of our time,” said FAO Director-General QU Dongyu, urging for stronger partnerships, more public and private investments in training for smallholder farmers, technology and innovation” to step up the fight against food loss and waste as “our planet is a small boat in the universe.”“Innovative postharvest treatment, digital agriculture and food systems and re-modelling market channels offer huge potential to tackle the challenges of food loss and waste. We have just built a partnership with IBM, Microsoft and the Vatican to empower Artificial Intelligence in all these areas,” added Qu.Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP, encouraged governments to make food loss and waste part of national climate strategies.“Only 11 countries have so far included food loss in their Nationally Determined Contributions. None of them included food waste. By including food loss and waste and sustainable diets in revised climate plans, policymakers can improve their mitigation and adaptation from food systems by as much as 25 percent,” said Andersen.Calling food loss and waste “an ethical outrage” given that so many people go hungry, António Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General, in a message sent in support of the Day, urged everyone to play their part in tackling this issue – from countries setting a reduction target and measuring their food loss and waste and policy action in this area being included in climate plans under the Paris Agreement to businesses taking a similar approach and individuals shopping carefully, storing food correctly, and using leftovers.The need for everyone to come together and step up efforts to reduce food loss and waste, including through innovation, technologies and education, to shift behavioural norms away from waste, to measure and track progress, as well as work towards increasing the availability of food and reducing the environmental footprint of agricultural production – topics to be explored in depth at the 2021 Food System Summit – were echoed by speakers and panel discussion participants from the UN, European Commission, private and public sectors, agriculture ministries of developing and developed countries, farmers’, markets’ and consumers’ organisations and associations, academia and chefs.Solutions to reduce food loss and wasteSolutions to stem food loss and waste include: good data to know where in the value chain the major hot spots of food loss and waste are; applying innovation - for example, e-commerce platforms for marketing or retractable mobile food processing systems; government incentives to bolster private sector food loss and waste action and collaboration across supply chains; investments in training, technology and innovation, including for small-scale producers; better food packaging and relaxing on regulations and standards on aesthetic requirements for fruit and vegetables; behaviours that value and make the most of food at home; redistributing safe surplus food to those in need through food banks; facilitating farmer’s access to consumers and shorter value chains through farmers markets and rural urban linkages; and investing more to strengthen infrastructure and logistics, including sustainable cold chains and cooling technologies.In many countries a large proportion of produce is lost during transportation. To address this, FAO has introduced improved, sustainable bulk packaging (in the form of stackable and nestable plastic crates), along with good post-harvest management practice, to transport fresh produce in a number of Southern and South-eastern Asian countries. The use of crates during transport has reduced losses of vegetables and fruits by up to 87 percent. Where crates replaced single-use plastic bags, this has also brought environmental benefits. (Source SOFA 2019, p. 36)UNEP, together with high-level coalition Champions 12.3, has developed a Target-Measure-Act approach to food loss and waste reduction. The United Kingdom, a pioneer of this approach, has achieved a 27 percent reduction in post-farm gate food loss and waste per capita by 2018 relative to its 2007 baseline, making it the first country in the world to have advanced more than halfway towards the achievement of SDG 12.3. Good data has helped the UK to make the case for action, together with an effective public-private partnership to facilitate cross supply chain collaboration, leveraging innovation in food promotion, labeling, and design, and a long-standing public behaviour change campaign, with re-doubled efforts and impacts on household food behaviours during the global pandemic. Several companies including Tesco (Central Europe), Campbell, and Arla Foods have achieved food loss and waste reductions of more than 25 percent—suggesting that achieving the target is possible for companies, too.A new African Centre of Excellence for sustainable cooling and cold chain based in Rwanda is helping get farmers’ produce to market quickly and efficiently – reducing food waste, boosting profits and creating jobs.Elsewhere, young entrepreneurs like Isaac Sesi – who spoke at the event – also fight food loss with innovation. Sesi and the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for the Reduction of Post-Harvest Loss at Kansas State University are providing farmers in Ghana – Isaac’s home country – with an affordable moisture meter called GrainMate, which measures the moisture content of maize and other grains, helping farmers ensure the grains are sufficiently dried and tackle the main cause of post-harvest loss in grain - insufficient drying before storage, which creates conditions for fungal growth, contamination and insect infestation.Elsewhere, young entrepreneurs like Isaac Sesi – who spoke at the event – also fight food loss with innovation.

{"title": "The future is circular: what biodiversity really means", "article": "Subtle shifts aren’t good enough, says Doreen Robinson, Chief of Wildlife at the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). It’s time for a system-wide transformation. On the day of the UN Summit on Biodiversity, Robinson explains where we’ve gone wrong and how we can do better.Why are we talking about biodiversity now – in the midst of a global disease pandemic, with economies stretched to their limits and a looming climate crisis? As we speak, more species are threatened with extinction than ever before. Extreme weather events – and consequently, fires, floods and droughts – are happening more frequently and with greater intensity; and zoonotic diseases like COVID-19 now account for the majority of infectious diseases emerging in humans.These are symptoms of a systemic problem, and this requires a systemic solution. We need to completely recalibrate our relationship to nature – and we need to do so, urgently.   Biodiversity is the foundation for all life on earth.How does biodiversity affect the actual experiences of people in their everyday lives?Biodiversity affects just about every aspect of human life, from job security and basic health to saving the planet for future generations.More than half of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP) is dependent on nature. Three-quarters of all food crop types – including fruits and vegetables and some of the most important cash crops, like coffee and almonds – require animal pollination. About half of the global population relies mainly on natural medicines and most of the drugs used to treat cancer are either natural or modelled after nature. So there is a direct and relationship between biodiversity and some very basic aspects of survival. There is also an important long-term, preventive aspect – which we are experiencing very acutely today.  Where native biodiversity is high, for example, the infection rate for some zoonotic diseases is lower.  So protecting natural habitats and wildlife is also a way to help protect ourselves.  Biodiversity is the basis for healthy ecosystems as well, and healthy ecosystems capture and store greenhouse gases and mitigate climate change, whereas damaged ecosystems release carbons and add to it.When we work with nature, it works with us. And when we work against nature, we dismantle the very system that supports and protects us.What exactly do you mean when you say “recalibrate our relationship to nature”?Human actions have typically been shaped by a paradigm in which a “good life” means material consumption and perpetual economic growth. For decades, we have extracted natural resources, destroyed critical habitats, and generated pollution.  Our relationship with nature is unbalanced: humans are continuously taking and discarding, and nature is continuously giving.  This one-way relationship is unsustainable.So we need to reset the balance: not just hoarding benefits, but investing as much back into nature as we extract from it. It’s time to develop a new paradigm that recognizes the value of nature and understands that life quality is not purely a matter of GDP. Instead of a linear approach in which things are used and discarded, we need to apply circular thinking in which life is sustained and things are continuously repurposed.  We need to think about these things in all the choices we make, from how we select and deliver the food we grow and eat to how we build our cities and provide water and electricity for our growing human population.In the context of global challenges we now face, and with so many jobs and industries dependent on traditional economic models, is this kind of dramatic change possible?Not only is it possible, but it is also our only hope.Aside from the unprecedented global challenges we are experiencing, biodiversity loss is making it difficult to ensure even the most basic human rights – nutritious food, clean water and affordable energy. It is undermining progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals. And without a fundamental shift in our approach, we are unlikely to keep global warming within safe limits – a failure that would only magnify the challenges we face in the future.It might seem counter-intuitive but, actually, now is the time to get serious about – precisely because of the challenges on our doorstep.  In times of uncertainty, biodiversity is a form of insurance, availing options and protecting us from shocks.It also creates opportunities for new jobs, innovations – and better, healthier lives. And by prioritizing resource-intensive sectors in the shift toward sustainable consumption and production, we have the potential to achieve very significant gains over a relatively short period.What does this mean in a practical sense: what specific actions need to be taken?This means translating good intentions into concrete action.As countries around the world launch various post-crisis initiatives and stimulus packages, we must include nature as part of those recovery packages.  That means natural capital must be included in decision making.  It means investing in green jobs including in areas of ecosystem protection and restoration.  Now is the time to establish new,nature-positive standards for production and consumption. And we need to invest in the environment dimensions of integrated One Health approaches to avoid future pandemics and other human health crises.  We can build back better – but only if we match words with deeds.At the same time, we cannot afford to lessen our commitments to securing a new, ambitious and accountable Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework that all of society can support.   Channel long-term financing and investment toward nature and climate health.  Currently, governments around the world spend more than US$500 billion every year in ways that harm biodiversity, primarily to support industries like fossil fuels, agriculture and fisheries.  These funds could be repurposed to incentivise regenerative agriculture, sustainable food systems, clean technology and nature-positive innovations. For more information, please contact Doreen Robinson: [email protected] "},
{"title": "Another wake-up call: sea ice loss is speeding up", "article": "Unprecedented wildfires, storms and glacier melt are the strongest indications yet of how climate change threatens life on Earth. The world has seen big declines in summer sea ice in the last two decades, with the lowest extent recorded in 2012. 13 September 2020 marked a new, troubling milestone – with Arctic sea ice shrinking to the second-lowest extent ever recorded. We asked United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) climate change expert Pascal Peduzzi to explain the significance of sea ice loss.UNEP: What happens to sea ice in the Arctic may seem remote and irrelevant to our daily lives. Why does sea ice loss matter?Pascal Peduzzi: It matters because the extent of sea ice affects local ecosystems, regional and global weather patterns, and ocean temperatures and circulation. If Arctic sea ice continues to shrink, we may see a summer ice-free Arctic Ocean by the mid-2040s and the disappearance of polar bears and other animals. However, there are also global consequences. Snow and ice help keep the planet cool because they reflect the sun’s rays back into space. Warmer temperatures mean Arctic sea ice is reduced, ocean temperatures rise, and the warmer water (with a bigger volume) contributes to sea-level rise.The lowest extent of sea ice on record was in 2012. Last year’s extent was almost as small, and now this year, on 13 September, we saw the second-lowest ever recorded Arctic sea ice minimum (3.709 million square kilometres). In addition, in 2020, the area of Arctic Sea Ice was the lowest on record for the month of July.Graph showing the Arctic sea ice extent. Graph by UNEPUNEP: Why is this happening? What is causing the loss of sea ice?PP: Increasing emissions of greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide (CO2), are to blame. The global trend in the increase in CO2 concentration is not only rising but accelerating. In 1960 it was +0.9 parts per million (ppm) per year, in 1980 +1.21 ppm; in 2000 +1.83 ppm and in 2020 it is +2.51 ppm/year. Global heating is real. There is a strong correlation in the long-term trends between CO2 emissions and atmospheric CO2 levels and we’re in danger of missing key Paris Climate Agreement goals as the emissions gap widens.UNEP: What is UNEP doing to highlight the dangers?PP: UNEP’s annual Emissions Gap Report along with the World Environment Situation Room are painting a worrying picture. Monthly global temperatures for January, February, March and July 2020, were the second warmest since records began in 1880, while in April, May and June 2020 they were the warmest ever on record since 1880.UNEP: What are the implications?PP: Reduced Arctic sea ice means increased ocean temperatures. Combined with melting glaciers on land, this contributes to sea-level rise, which is accelerating. Between 1994 and 2010 sea-level rise averaged 3.3 mm per year, but since 2010 it has been rising at an average of 5.7 mm per year.Graph showing the Arctic sea-level rise between 1980-2020. Graph by UNEPA warming world threatens the planet’s library of life, including our own existence. We need to change the way we do agriculture, our industry, the way we travel, and how we heat and cool our homes. We need to ramp up renewable energy and rapidly phase out fossil fuels. We need to implement nature-based solutions and introduce a circular economy. Solutions exist, but their implementation is too slow. We also need more data and science. Governments need to get serious about climate action. The United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021 - 2030) proclaimed in December 2017, will provide a common framework to ensure that ocean science can fully support countries’ actions to sustainably manage the oceans and more particularly to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.For more information, please contact Pascal Peduzzi: [email protected]"},
{"title": "Landmark UNEP report lighting the path to a sustainable future to be released in January ", "article": "COVID-19 has exposed how the degradation of ecosystems is not only undermining Earth’s life-supporting systems, including the regulation of disease but also leaving our societies and economies tremendously vulnerable to sudden shocks.Even before the pandemic, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) had commissioned the broadest synthesis yet of scientific insights into the huge environmental challenges facing humanity so that policymakers can see clearly what must be done. More than 40 authors and advisors from around the world are working on the report, which will be released in early 2021.Heads of state will grapple with these issues at the UN Summit on Biodiversity, due to take place on 30 September during the UN General Assembly in New York. Before the summit, lead authors Bob Watson and Ivar Baste discuss how to fix the climate, prevent a mass extinction and set a course for a sustainable future – all at the same time.Why should governments facing a public health emergency and nose-diving economies pay attention to another UN environmental report? It is essential that the world learns from COVID-19. The pandemic is demonstrating for all to see how the destruction of Earth’s natural systems can lead to sudden shocks with massive impacts around the world. Our report will explain how putting our relationship with nature on a sustainable footing will not only reduce the risks of climate change, biodiversity loss and the outbreak of diseases but also make our societies and economies more resilient in the face of the environmental changes, including future pandemics, that we cannot prevent.We need to learn our lesson quickly because, economic recovery packages that many governments are preparing are an unmissable opportunity to accelerate some of the changes we need. Investing in things like green energy, sustainable cities and agriculture, and resource-efficient manufacturing can create millions of jobs and equip societies for the future.The causes and mechanisms of climate change, biodiversity loss and land degradation are complex. Why consider all of these problems together? Because the underlying causes of each of these issues are the same, and all are related to the unsustainable production and consumption of natural resources by a wealthier and growing human population. These issues impact and reinforce each other. Climate change not only adversely affects biodiversity, land degradation and air and water quality, it is in turn affected by them. While climate change has not been the most important driver of biodiversity loss to date, it is projected to become as or more important than the other drivers in the coming decades. So it is critical that these issues are addressed simultaneously through policies and technologies that work together to maximize the benefits while minimizing any trade-offs or unintended consequences.For example, it is well established that, with careful planning and management, halting deforestation and restoring degraded ecosystems in developing countries can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect biodiversity, prevent soil erosion, and safeguard supplies of water and fuel for local communities all at the same time. But even this kind of broad policy initiative will have limited success unless we tackle the drivers of deforestation, which include issues as diverse as insecure tenure in developing countries, lack of universal access to clean energy, and high demand for meat and dairy products in wealthier societies. The report will help us to appreciate the magnitude and complexity of the environmental problem we are dealing with so that we can design smart responses that can really solve them.Experts are increasingly calling for “transformative change” in order to put the world on a sustainable path. What does that really mean, and what are the urgent actions that policymakers should take to bring about real change? Transformative change is broad-based and far-reaching change on a scale that matches the big environmental issues we face. It requires changes in thinking and behaviour, in structures and systems. It is daunting, there is no blueprint, and it won’t happen overnight. But it can take us a long way toward the more sustainable and fairer world we need and is surely achievable with the wealth of resources and knowledge that humanity has at its disposal.Perhaps the most important aspects of this change is the transformation of our economic and financial systems. We need to align production, consumption, infrastructure and human settlements with ecological realities. We need to be able to raise living standards and well-being without using more resources or producing more waste than the planet can supply or absorb. This transformation will likely involve, for instance, incorporating natural capital accounting in decision-making, eliminating harmful subsidies, internalizing environmental costs and benefits, and embracing a circular economy.Transformation also will require changing the way we organize our societies and activities. We need to embrace cross-sectoral planning and management. We need to change aspects of our behaviour, culture, values and norms - individually, collectively and in organizations. Changes in national and international governance structures, policies, business models, technologies, education, and knowledge systems will be needed.The investments required to transform our economies and societies seem massive. How can we afford it? The real question is: how can we afford not to? We have no chance of achieving our economic and social goals unless we can reach our environmental goals at the same time, for instance by transitioning to a low-carbon economy while preserving and restoring our ecosystems. Issues such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, land degradation, and air and water pollution should not be viewed only as environmental issues, but rather as economic, development, social, security, moral and ethical issues. This is the logic of the Sustainable Development Goals: they are indivisible, interdependent and can only be achieved together.While the full costs of addressing all of these issues are hard to assess, it seems clear that the cost of inaction could be far greater than the cost of action, i.e., the costs of adapting to climate change are likely to be much higher than the costs of limiting/mitigating climate change. While some may argue that financial resources are in short supply, especially after the economic hit from the COVID-19 pandemic, trillions of dollars are spent annually on economic subsidies that cause environmental damage, such as those for agriculture, fossil fuel energy, and transportation. These subsidies could be eliminated and the money saved invested in a sustainable and resilient economy.Another reason to turn this argument on its head is that investing in a green economy is investing in the economy of the future. It will create jobs and prosperity for the businesses, investors and governments that recognize this an opportunity. Ultimately, these are critical investments that will take us closer to our goal of securing sustainable development for all while living in harmony with nature.\n     This project is co-funded by the European Union "},
{"title": "Amid COVID-19, these 10 countries are aiming to kickstart their economies by repairing nature ", "article": "In 1933, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an executive order allocating US$ 10 million for emergency conservation efforts under the New Deal, putting unemployed Americans to work. When South Korea was struggling with famine and a refugee crisis in the 1950s, the government restored forests and farmland, creating hundreds of thousands of rural jobs.Fast forward to the COVID-19 crisis, and some states are once again using restoration as an engine of employment, especially in rural areas where jobs are badly needed. That strategy not only has the potential to kickstart economic growth, it’s also key in the fight against climate change and biodiversity loss. Reviving nature is at the core of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, a global push to repair lands lost to development that is set to begin in 2021.“A green recovery is one that tackles the climate, biodiversity and pollution crises at the same time,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme. “Some countries are already designing stimulus packages that include actions for forests, wetlands, soils and green cities. At the UN Biodiversity Summit, we saw a remarkable groundswell of political commitment to nature. But now we must step up on a massive-scale, actions to restore our degraded ecosystems.”Mother and daughter planting trees in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

{"title": "Youth band together to demand leaders take action #ForNature", "article": "Today, a group of youth leaders presented a Manifesto and Open Letter during the Nature for Life Hub at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The initiative draws from a wide body of work by youth groups across the world and outlines 12 priorities of young people to be addressed to achieve the 2050 vision of “living in harmony with nature.” The effort is positioned as: By Youth. To World Leaders. #ForNature.The Youth #forNature initiative is led by the United Nations Major Group for Children and Youth (UNMGCY) and is connected to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Major Group for Children and Youth, Global Youth Biodiversity Network, YOUNGO-Youth for Climate, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) Global Youth Caucus and Youth for Our Planet.The young people, who come from different social backgrounds, ethnicities, genders and geographies, requested world leaders to declare a “planetary emergency,” in relation to the worsening climate and biodiversity crises. They ask for heads of state to develop strategies for effective conservation and restoration, adopt binding environmental targets, create transformative education in schools, uphold the rights of Indigenous peoples, protect environmental defenders, ensure intergenerational equity and to be accountable. “Our generation has seen many of the promises of the Millennium Development Goals, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and the Kyoto Protocol fail. We need real transformative change,” said the group’s letter. In July, UN Secretary-General António Guterres launched a Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change comprising seven young leaders who will provide perspectives and solutions to help tackle the worsening climate crisis, shape COVID-19 recovery, and confront injustice and inequality.Youth advocates have emphasized that while COVID-19 recovery packages are focusing on economic relief, the sustainability aspect cannot be left behind. Climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental degradation are a “shadow” pandemic and need similar levels of action, they said.Scientific and economic studies estimate that 75 per cent of the land, 66 per cent of oceans, and 85 per cent of wetlands have been negatively altered by human activity. While a new WWF report finds a 68 per cent decline in species population sizes since 1970.Youth realise that this is the world they will inherit. A recent survey of millennials — 30,000 individuals under the age of 30 from 186 countries — found that climate change and the destruction of nature were the most critical issues for them.The Climate Cardinals, an international non-profit led by the youngest member of the Secretary General’s Youth Advisory Group on Climate, Sophia Kianni, is working to translate climate change research and information. It will make the Manifesto and Letter available in multiple languages so that they can reach as many young people and leaders as possible and enable the effort to be the most widely distributed petition on planetary health for human wellbeing.“In order for youth from around the world to come together #ForNature, it is crucial for biodiversity information to be available in a plethora of different languages,” said Kianni.The Youth #forNature initiative aims to rouse greater commitment from global leaders in the run-up to several global conferences including the UN General Assembly Biodiversity Summit on the 30th of September 2020 and the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA)-5 in February 2021. The group has the support of its group of “elders” from UNEP, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)."}
