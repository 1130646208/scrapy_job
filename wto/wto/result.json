Deputy Director-General Yi Xiaozhun provided  opening remarks to mark the launch of the new platform, recalling that the \nAgreement on Import Licensing  Procedures\n is one of the oldest agreements in the history of the  WTO and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). He highlighted that its  establishment dates back to the Tokyo Round of trade negotiations (1973–79). \nDDG Yi stressed that as one of the most frequently used trade policy instruments  applied by almost all governments, the use of import licensing has extended  from enforcing quantitative restrictions and collecting trade statistics to  safeguarding product quality, the environment, consumer welfare, public health and  national security. \n\"Transparency makes trade more inclusive and predictable. Enhanced  efficiency, achieved through easy access to information, further reduces trade  costs of both exporters and importers. I fully believe that the new WTO import  licensing database will significantly improve transparency in this important  field and will benefit all members, especially those developing members who  have capacity and resource constraints, as well as SMEs and MSMEs,\" DDG Yi  said. Read his \nfull  statement\n.  \nThe new database is a comprehensive information centre containing all  members' legislation, procedures and product information relating to import  licensing. Offering a user-friendly interface, the platform will allow members  and the business community to find import licensing information more  efficiently and to make better use of the information contained in members' notifications. \nWith the technical support of the WTO's Information Technology Solutions  Division (ITSD), staff at the Market Access Division designed the structure of  the new platform, reviewed and analyzed all import licensing notifications  submitted by members since 1995 and uploaded profiles of 134 members. They also  verified over 2,500 pieces of legislation to make sure all links lead to the  relevant information and to ensure accuracy regarding more than 1,000 products  and procedures. \nMembers took the floor to congratulate the Secretariat for the hard work  in creating the database and noted that the new platform will be a valuable  contribution to the Committee's activities. It will also promote compliance  with WTO members' transparency obligations. This will be especially helpful for  developing countries which have capacity constraints. Many members emphasized  that the database is a powerful example of how WTO members can improve  transparency in a way that also assists importers and exporters.\nThe platform can be accessed \nhere\n.\n\n          Import licences are permits granted before a product is imported. The  administrative procedures for obtaining the licences should be simple, neutral,  equitable and transparent. Where possible they should be given automatically  and quickly, and even if they are non-automatic, they should not obstruct trade  unnecessarily.\n"},

In the run-up to the 12th Ministerial Conference in June, ministers need to work together, he said, to reform WTO rules. This would not only result in increased production in a sustainable manner but would also have a positive impact on the environment. This is what he said:", "detail": "As we come to the close of the second decade of the second  millennium, the challenges to agricultural policy, never inconsiderable, are of  a different nature and magnitude than those faced by prior generations. Among  these are major changes in weather patterns, emerging environmental constraints  and the increasing use of trade measures to deal with geopolitical objectives.  The technological context in which  agricultural policies will be set is evolving rapidly.  The global economy is well on its way to  becoming to a large extent digital.   While less understood, artificial intelligence  will play an increasingly stronger role.   Biotechnology will shape the production of food. Taken together these  forces will shape global agriculture in the coming decades.  The changes wrought will be as profound as those  that occurred due to the Green Revolution\n(1)\n.  Added to these challenges will be demographic  changes both in population size and location, outbreaks of animal and plant  diseases and changes in consumer preferences affecting which foods are in  increasing demand.\nThis past year was characterized by disruptive events --  extremes of weather decimated the onion crop in India, swine flu had a severe  impact on the domestic supply of pork in China, trade hostilities between the  U.S. and China have shifted trade flows, and widespread bush fires in Australia  are having a substantial impact on food production in that country.\nThe decision of Minister Julia Klöckner in hosting this 12th  Agriculture Ministers' Summit giving special attention to international trade  is particularly timely as the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference will  be held in June 2020.  It is now  necessary for agriculture ministers to join together to consider how best to  provide answers to common concerns and to reflect solutions in trade  negotiations in a demanding global policy and physical environment.\nMultilateral trade agreements will be needed to meet these challenges.   Solutions will be needed in at least six  areas:  \nAgriculture ministers of major exporting and importing countries  have a special responsibility\n(3)\n to address, through trade negotiations, challenges in which trade plays or can play  a part:  \nThe world needs a smoothly operating  agricultural machine, and the parts of that machine, national agricultural  policies need to complement each other, not run at cross purposes.  Trade rules provide the necessary guarantee  that food will be available at affordable prices when needed thereby ensuring  livelihood security, particularly for rural households. Trade rules also help  to ensure that food is safe by allowing countries to impose appropriate  sanitary and phytosanitary measures without unnecessarily restricting trade.   \nIn short\n, trade rules allow all countries to take care of their  food security by working cooperatively with each other.\nThe WTO Agreement on Agriculture rests on the unstated  recognition by all WTO Members that the agricultural policies of others matter.  This is true whether the Member involved is a net importer or a net exporter,  whether it is developed or developing.   Also unstated is the conclusion reached that no bilateral or regional  agreement can be sufficient to address many of the most pressing issues of  agricultural trade, particularly domestic support.  Only a multilateral approach is possible.\nThe international system is in the process of moving from  one based solely on the nation state to one in which national governments increasingly  take an active interest in other countries’ policies, especially those that result  in effects outside those countries’ borders. \n(4)\n  Insofar as agriculture is concerned, this  evolution can be seen in the Agreement on Agriculture which went into effect  when the WTO was created.  The Agreement  set limits on the amount of domestic support (subsidies) that any Member could  give.  The next step in this process of  international responsibility was the banning of agricultural export subsidies  at Nairobi Ministerial Meeting in 2015.   The process is likely to go further.   At present, WTO Members have tabled proposals to place additional limits  on the granting of domestic support.  \nThe WTO is turning 25 this month, as are the Agreement on  Agriculture, the Agreement on on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures  and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade.  These and many other WTO  agreements – including the Trade Facilitation Agreement - adopted in 2013 and  the Decision on Export Competition in 2015 - have successfully contributed to the  reform of the agriculture sector and made the trading environment more  predictable and fairer.  \nMore needs to be done. Trade distortions, particularly in the  form of subsidies that often also contribute to maintaining unsustainable  production methods must be reduced.  Further efforts are needed to  discipline border measures that often take the form of high tariffs and export  restrictions.\n As Agriculture Ministers, you need an effective  multilateral trading system and, as important, the WTO needs your active  engagement.  Reform of the WTO's  rules would not only result in increased production in a sustainable manner to  feed the world’s growing population but will also have a positive impact on the  environment.  You have a chance to  multiply the benefits of your policies by becoming more deeply involved in trade  negotiations and through collaborating extensively with your trade  colleagues.  I urge you to do so.\nThank you.\nNotes:\n   See for example the World Economic Forum Paper posted at  \nhttps://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/01/how-to-build-a-circular-economy-for-food/\n. \n Back to text\n The term “countries” is meant here to include the  European Union.\n Back to text\n Richard Haass, in an article in Foreign Affairs in \nJanuary/February 2017\n,   entitled \nWorld Order 2.0,  The Case For Sovereign Obligation\n, cites the WTO as an example of countries  contributing to a global order in part through agreements that regulate  policies that in much of world history was considered solely a matter of  domestic concern. \n Back to text\n"}
