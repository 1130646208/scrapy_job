DDG Yi thanked the World Customs Organization (WCO) for its excellent custodianship of this committee, which has ensured uniformity in the interpretation and application of the WTO’s Customs Valuation Agreement since its adoption in 1995. This is what he said:", "detail": "Dr. Kunio Mikuriya, Secretary General, WCO:Mr. Jan Birkhoff, Chairperson of the TCCV,Mr. John W.H. Denton AO, Secretary General, International Chamber  of Commerce,Former Chairpersons of the TCCV,Members of the TCCV\nLadies and  gentlemen,\nI am honoured to join you in  commemorating the 50th Session of the Technical Committee onCustoms Valuation. I would like to express my heartiest congratulations to all  of you on reaching this significant milestone. On behalf of the four  Deputy Directors-General Interim of the WTO, I also wish to  express the sincere gratitude of the WTO to the WCO for its excellent  custodianship of the Technical Committee on Customs Valuation over the past 25  years. The Technical Committee is one of the pillars of the Customs  Valuation Agreement and has the pivotal task of ensuring, at a technical level,  uniformity in the interpretation and application of the Agreement. The fact  that we are today at the opening of the 50th Session is  testament to the continual commitment shown by the WCO Secretariat and the  members of the Technical Committee to its implementation.\nWhile 2020 marks the 25th anniversary  of the Customs Valuation Agreement, you will recall that the  issue was first regulated internationally under Article VII of the GATT in  1947. However, it was the plurilateral customs valuation  code concluded in 1979 under the GATT Tokyo Round that  provided for the first time a detailed regulation of customs  valuation and sought to bring a uniform set of detailed rules. The  Uruguay Round paved the way for this plurilateral code to become a multilateral  agreement.\nAware of the importance  of fair, uniform and neutral customs valuation processes on  international trade flows, it was important for the  negotiators that the Customs  Valuation Agreement act as a bulwark against any erosion or  elimination of the market access opportunities achieved through tariff  reductions as a result of arbitrary, fictitious  or non-transparent valuation methodologies. And considerable trade and capacity building  was foreseen in order to assist developing countries and LDCs to  fully implement the CVA after 2004.\nThe trading  environment 70, 41 and 25 years ago was a world away  from that in which we operate today. Global  trade has grown and developed in ways that the negotiators of the  Customs Valuation Agreement could never have foreseen. I would like to  focus on just one aspect of international trade, which is that of the  reshaping of global value chains. The reshaping of value chains will  give rise to new and emerging business models and trade developments that in  all likelihood will require further interpretation of the application of the  Customs Valuation Agreement, at least at the technical level.\nIn 1995, when the  Agreement entered into force, technological advances together  with predictable market conditions gave rise  to the phenomenon of global value chains  that currently dominate manufacturing production and trade. Over  the years, multinational enterprises have increasingly grown to  take the lion’s share of overall trade in many countries even  though SMEs were estimated to account for between 80-99 per cent  of firms in any given country.  As a result, SMEs had a  lower participation rate in international trade and global  value chains than big business, and most SMEs did not  export at all.\nToday, however, those global  value chains are being reshaped as a result of rising demand and new  industry capabilities in the developing world as well as a wave of new  technologies. Instant and low-cost digital communication is lowering  transaction costs. New business models are being created through the  digital economy which could result in an increasing number  of small and medium enterprises being in a better position to  gain increased access to foreign markets through online sales and  ecommerce. New research finds that development of a website  by manufacturing SMEs facilitates its participation in GVCs and  trade. Similar opportunities would also extend to Micro  business and individuals that want to engage in international  trade.  And those technological developments also impacted many  other areas that are important for valuation purpose: 3-d printing and  bitcoin are also just examples of issues that became relevant for international  trade only a few years ago.\nThese varying and uncertain  developments will likely impact the day-to-day interpretation and application  of the CVA to changing valuation issues.  How will the Committee on  Customs Valuation respond? How can the Technical Committee ensure,  at the technical level, uniformity in interpretation and application of this  Agreement in this constantly evolving and changing trading environment,  which has been further bustled by the Covid-19 pandemic?  There are  important and challenging discussions ahead.\nWhile raising potential  upcoming challenges, it is necessary to continue our work to address  the ongoing challenges that persist for some of the Membership.  I know  that for some Members, in particular developing and least developed  countries, the challenges are real and heavy.   For example,  customs duties represent an important revenue stream for a number of  countries; their trade policy can include the imposition of high tariffs, their  economies can have a large informal trading sector which is not regulated.  In addition, their customs administrations  can suffer from the lack of the customs expertise that is required to implement  the customs valuation agreement, as well as a lack of resources in general.  These are all challenges to the application of the Customs Valuation Agreement  in a number of developing and least-developed countries. The assistance provided  by the on-going technical work of the Technical Committee on Customs  Valuation continues to play an important role in addressing  these challenges.\nAs I  conclude my remarks, I would like to highlight the fact that  today, customs valuation cannot be looked at in a silo.  This was brought  home, in particular by the WTO Trade Facilitation agreement which resulted in significant changes,  many of which are directly relevant to customs valuation.\nThe Customs Valuation Agreement itself  facilitates trade by ensuring that the customs value of  goods will be based on the true value of goods that was negotiated between  buyer and seller. Other measures such as the separation of the release from the  final determination of the customs duties are also trade-facilitating. It  could actually be considered a forward-looking agreement for its  time.\nThe implementation of  the Trade Facilitation Agreement directly supports the use  of transaction value through its provisions on pre-arrival  processing, post-clearance audit, advance rulings, risk management, authorized  operators and independent appeal mechanisms. The TFA  transparency and consultation provisions can strengthen the  possibility for the private sector to engage with customs administrations  as a means of resolving potential undervaluation issues while not unnecessarily  impeding trade. At the WTO, the Committee on Customs Valuation has engaged with  the Committee on Trade Facilitation in an effort to raise the awareness  within the membership of the linkage between both agreements  and encouraging consideration of means by which the  Trade Facilitation Agreement can enhance the implementation of  the Customs Valuation Agreement, particularly for developing and  least-developed counties.\nBy requiring that customs  value be based on simple and equitable criteria consistent with commercial  practices, the CVA has proven to be very flexible and successful at adapting to  a changing environment.  However, the changes are coming in more quickly  and are more transformational.  So, as we look to the future, my  invitation to you is to consider a closer working relationship  between the Technical Committee, which after all is an integral part of the  Agreement, and the Customs Valuation Committee in Geneva to explore  options for further mutual benefits in the implementation of the  Customs Valuation Agreement.\nIn all cases, we at the WTO  look forward to continuing our constructive and fruitful partnership with you  as we look ahead to the next 25 years of implementation of the  Customs Valuation Agreement in cooperation with the essential supporting role  of the Technical Committee on Customs Valuation.\nOnce again, I thank you for  the opportunity to participate in this commemorative event and I wish you a  successful 50th session.\nThank you.\n"},

But the role of trade and the WTO on the  environment is complex, and as a result, it is not always well understood,”  Deputy Director-General Alan Wolff said at the event. “The short answers  to the big questions that we are launching today serve as signposts that can  guide us on the road towards a WTO that works better for people, the planet and  prosperity in the 21st century.”\n“The debate on trade and the environment is likely to  become even more prominent in the years ahead. One big reason is the COVID-19 pandemic,  which has pushed environmental issues up the local, national, regional and  global policy agendas,” DDG Wolff added. “The current crisis calls  for a collective response on trade that fosters sustainability, inclusiveness  and resilience.” His full speech is availablehere.\nThe publication provides easy-to-understand answers to some  of the key questions in the trade and environment debate, such as whether  restricting trade would help the environment, whether to buy local, and whether  governments can subsidize green technologies.\nThe publication underlines that, while more economic  activity and transportation can have an impact on the environment, by promoting  development, economic efficiency and the dissemination of environmentally  friendly goods and services, trade helps countries use resources efficiently  and pursue sustainability objectives. It emphasizes that WTO rules do not  prevent ambitious environmental action and that governments are widely using  trade measures to protect the environment.\nIn cases where an environmental measure restricts trade, the  publication explains four of the checks provided under WTO rules to ensure the  measure is not disguised protectionism nor creates unjustifiable or arbitrary  discrimination. Such a measure must be: coherent and justified by a legitimate  environmental objective, not to protect domestic sectors; fit-for-purpose in  that it effectively contributes to the objective; mindful of the impact on  other countries and part of a holistic environmental policy; and flexible in  considering alternative measures to achieve the same outcome. Several WTO  dispute cases highlighted in the publication confirm the importance of these  considerations.\nThe publication ends by looking at the role of the WTO in  furthering WTO members' sustainability objectives. It underlines that  rules-based trade provides predictability for global commerce and contributes  to a coherent approach to environmental trade policies. The WTO also provides an  important forum for members to debate trade and environment issues and to work  towards achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.\n"},

And it is what we  are committed to.\nIn that regard, we have  remained in contact with the General Council Chair and Members, as  appropriate.\nIn preparing for today's  meetings, and acting in coordination with the GC Chair, we held a virtual  meeting of Negotiating Group Chairs, on the 2nd of October. At that  meeting, the Chairs stressed the importance of continuing to carry out the work  of the TNC during the transition period; and of keeping Members informed about ongoing  developments in the negotiating bodies.\nThey stressed that it was important  to keep working — as Members indeed have work to do.  I believe that this is also what we heard  from many of you at the last TNC/HoDs meetings in July.\nThe Chairs informed us that, since  July, a number of them had resumed work or contacts in various configurations. I  will, shortly, give the Chairs whose groups have seen developments since July the  opportunity to report to you.\nIn addition, the Chairs of the special  sessions of the TRIPS Council and the Services Council will soon reach out to  delegations for your views on how to advance work in these areas. We should hopefully  hear reports on their outreach efforts at our next meeting.\nBut, before moving to the  reports from the chairs, I would like to update you on the management of the  Secretariat during this interim period, including our own recent activities as  DDGs.\nWe, the DDGs, wish to reassure all  Heads of Delegation that the transition has been smooth, in line with your  instructions at the General Council. The Secretariat continues to function normally  in all areas of its work, and remains available, as usual, to support  delegations with all means at its disposal.\nI am happy to report that since  the summer break, we have witnessed an increase in the number of meetings and  activities on-site — with many delegations returning to the building. We welcome  this.\nIn this regard, let me assure  all delegations that the top objective of the Secretariat's Health Task  Force  is   to ensure that the WTO remains one of the safest places in town. While  there have been isolated cases of staff members testing positive for COVID-19,  there is no evidence of spread within the Centre William Rappard despite the  increased numbers of people here. This, I am sure, can be traced to the good  practices that we have adopted.\nWe will continue to count on your  cooperation in adhering to the sanitary guidelines that we have put in place,  to ensure the safest possible environment for Members and the Secretariat to  meet and work.\nIn addition, we are responding  to Members' requests to increase the number of meeting rooms, equipped with  virtual technology for hybrid meetings. This month, two additional rooms were  made available to delegations.  At the  same time, we continue to explore other platforms to find better, lower-cost  alternatives.\nWe — the DDGs — want to ensure  that the WTO maintains its engagement with all stakeholders during this  transition period. And so we have continued with outreach activities in Geneva  and elsewhere, mainly through digital platforms.\nIn all these discussions, the  economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have featured prominently.\nOur activities have included:\nWe have also had several contacts  with many of you — Ambassadors — here in Geneva.\nIn all of these discussions, we  have emphasized the critical importance of international cooperation and  coordination to meet today's challenges. We stress the importance of open and  predictable markets to foster a strong and inclusive  recovery for all countries. And we make clear  that closing off trade would mean unnecessary supply shocks, slower global  trade growth, weaker productivity and lower living standards.\nG20  Trade and Investment Ministers pledged to continue cooperation and coordination  to support the recovery of international trade and investment, and to support  the necessary reform of the WTO. The G20 Ministers also underscored the  significance of ongoing WTO negotiations, and reiterated their support for an  agreement by 2020 on comprehensive and effective disciplines on fisheries  subsidies.\nThe  G20 Communiqué was circulated to all Members at the request of the delegation  of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as document WT/GC/221.\nLast  week, WTO economists provided some positive news about global trade flows  following the deep, COVID-19 induced slump.\nJune and July  saw stronger-than-expected growth in merchandise trade. Our economists now  predict that the volume of global merchandise trade will shrink by 9.2% this  year compared to 2019. This would be among the worst contractions in years, on  par with the drop seen during the 2008-09 crisis. But it is significantly  better than the 13% drop that appeared likely in June, which would have been  the worst fall in trade since the 1930s. And back in April, when our economists  issued their first forecast for the year, that 13% contraction represented a  relatively optimistic scenario. They projected that, if the outbreak and the  policy response took turns for the worse, merchandise trade could fall by 32%,  or even more.\nAnother positive  sign for trade is that imports and exports are clearly helping to meet the  sharply rising demand for key medical goods. For example, new trade data shows  that trade in personal protective equipment (PPE) in the second quarter of this  year was 92% higher than the year before — 122% higher if we compare May of  this year to the same month in 2019. This confirms that trade is part of the  solution when it comes to supply resilience.\nNone of this  means we can afford complacency or inaction. While precise data are not yet available,  we know that services trade has been badly affected, with a sharp fall in  travel and in-person services. And even for merchandise trade, the 7.2% rise  foreseen for 2021 would leave us below the pre-crisis trend, with serious  downside risks from a possible resurgence of the pandemic that could disrupt  the trade recovery.\nWe must remain vigilant, and  continue to lay the groundwork for a strong, sustained and inclusive economic recovery.  For job creation and growth, the policy choices you adopt at home will matter. So  will the decisions and actions you take here at the WTO.\nThis includes transparency and  information-sharing. We are pleased that Members  continue to discuss COVID-19 related trade measures in relevant WTO bodies, as  well as share information with the Secretariat's pandemic-related trade  monitoring work.\nAlso,  in relation to our transparency mandate, let me take this opportunity to remind  you that the preparatory process for the WTO’s end-of-year trade monitoring  reports has been underway since early September. We urge you all to provide the  necessary information to the Secretariat.\nThe  pandemic and its impacts only compound the challenges that our organization was  already confronting. Our task now is not only to ensure  that trade contributes, in every way possible, to making the COVID-19 response  more effective. It is also to ensure that the trading system emerges from this  crisis stronger and better-equipped to respond to the aspirations of all  Members. This means bringing ongoing reform efforts to fruition, in the  shape of new agreements and renewed cooperation.\nWith these remarks, let me now turn to the reports of  the Chairs of Negotiating Bodies. I will start  with Fisheries Subsidies.\n[Chairs  of Negotiating Bodies take the floor.]\nThank you all for your reports  and for your tireless efforts in assisting Members to advance their work.\nBefore opening the floor for  discusison, I wish to reiterate that it is our hope that under the leadership  of our capable Chairs, you will continue to identify and refine potential  landing zones and areas of convergence. The goal is to build an environment in  which the new Director-General — as Chair of the TNC — will have a clear sense  of the way forward, instead of having to grapple with both old and new knots.\nPolitical will and pragmatism remain  essential as always, as is the need to take all voices into account. The  process remains firmly within your hands.\n"},

These disciplines apply to licensing  and qualification requirements as well as procedures and technical standards  for trade in services. The objective is to create good regularity  practices that mitigate any unintended trade-restrictive effects of procedures  for authorizing the supply of services.\nThe  Chair, Jaime Coghi Arias of Costa Rica, stressed the participants' objective of  finalising the negotiating text by the end of the year. “Achieving an  agreement on outstanding drafting issues as soon as possible would be of critical  importance,” he said.\nThe disciplines are designed to be compatible with WTO  members' diverse regulatory systems and approaches. They provide for built-in  flexibilities to facilitate governments' implementation of the measures domestically. They also aim to respond to the practical  challenges faced by businesses, particularly those arising from the COVID-19  pandemic.\nThe meetings are member-driven, transparent, inclusive  and open to all WTO members. Participating members — both  developing and developed countries — account for 72 per cent of world services trade.\nMinisters from 59 WTO members launched  negotiations at the 11th Ministerial Conference held in December 2017 in Buenos  Aires. In May 2019, ministers meeting on the side  lines of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development meetingsconfirmed their  commitmentto deliver a meaningful outcome by the 12th  Ministerial Conference.\nThe new disciplines under negotiation are set out in a draft  Reference Paper. According to the Chair, these negotiations are “at a very  advanced stage”. Participating members are also submitting draft  schedules on how the disciplines will be incorporated in their respective domestic  regulatory regimes under the WTO'sGeneral Agreement on Trade in  Services (GATS). A total of 30 draft schedules  (representing 57 WTO members) have been submitted so far.\nMr Coghi highlighted delegations' “positive engagement” in the  negotiations. He stressed the importance of “continuing internal consultations”  and of “looking for concrete solutions” to resolve the remaining  differences.\nEach  WTO member's schedule of commitments can be accessedhere.

Members also discussed the extension of the transitional period for least developed countries (LDCs) to implement the TRIPS Agreement and a submission on the competitiveness of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) through the protection of IP rights.", "detail": "Some 40 members engaged in a substantive discussion on a  proposal submitted by India and South Africa for a temporary waiver of certain  TRIPS obligations they said would facilitate an appropriate response to  COVID-19. The proposal suggests a waiver for all WTO members on the  implementation, application and enforcement of certain provisions of the TRIPS  Agreement in relation to the “prevention, containment or treatment” of  COVID-19. The proponents argued this would avoid barriers to the timely access  to affordable medical products including vaccines and medicines or to  scaling-up of research, development, manufacturing and supply of essential  medical products.\nThe waiver would cover obligations in four sections ofPart II of  the TRIPS Agreement— Section 1 on copyright and related rights, Section 4  on industrial designs, Section 5 on patents and Section 7 on the protection of  undisclosed information. It would last for a specific number of years, as agreed  by the General Council, and until widespread vaccination is in place globally  and the majority of the world's population is immune. Members would review the  waiver annually until its termination.\nAccording to the proponents, an effective response to the  COVID-19 pandemic requires rapid access to affordable medical products such as  diagnostic kits, medical masks, other personal protective equipment and  ventilators as well as vaccines and medicines. The outbreak has led to a swift  increase in global demand, with many countries facing shortages, constraining  the ability to effectively respond to the outbreak. As new diagnostics,  therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19 are developed, there were significant  concerns about how these will be made available promptly in sufficient  quantities and at affordable prices to meet global demand.\nThe proponents argued that many countries — especially  developing countries — may face institutional and legal difficulties when using  TRIPS flexibilities, including the special compulsory licensing mechanism  provided for inArticle  31bis, which they saw as a cumbersome process for the import and export of  pharmaceutical products. Now was the time for the WTO as an organization to  rise up to the collective call for defeating the pandemic. The WTO would not  succeed in its efforts to rebuild the COVID-19 affected economies unless it  acts now to first save those lives that are going to build these economies. It  is time for members to take collective responsibility and put people's lives  before anything else, they concluded.\nWhile a number of developing and least developed country  members welcomed the proposal as a contribution to the discussion, many were  still studying it in their capitals and asked for clarification on certain points,  particularly regarding its practical implementation and the possible economic  and legal impact of the waiver at national level. A number of developing and developed  country members opposed the waiver proposal, noting that there is no indication  that intellectual property rights (IPRs) have been a genuine barrier to accessing  COVID-19 related medicines and technologies.\nWhile acknowledging that the sustained and continued supply  of such medicines and technologies is a difficult task, they observed that  non-efficient and underfunded health care and procurement systems, spiking  demand and lack of manufacturing capacity are much more likely to impede access  to these materials. In the view of these members, solutions can be legitimately  sought within the existing IP system as the TRIPS Agreement provides enough tools  and sufficient policy space for members to take measures to protect public  health. The suspension of IPRs, even for a limited period of time, was not only  unnecessary but it would also undermine the collaborative efforts to fight the  pandemic that are already under way.\nGiven this range of positions, the Council chair, Ambassador  Xolelwa Mlumbi-Peter of South Africa, said that the item would remain suspended  as members continue to consider the proposal. Requests for waivers concerning  WTO agreements must be submitted initially to the relevant council for  consideration. After 90 days, the TRIPS Council has to submit a report to the  Ministerial Conference. Given that the proposal was submitted on 2 October, the  90-day time-period expires on 31 December 2020. The TRIPS Council meeting will  be reconvened on the item of the waiver proposal as appropriate before that  date, the chair said.\nThere was  general appreciation among delegations for the WTO Secretariat's work in  maintaining the list of COVID-19 related IP measures on the WTO website and  broad support for a continued discussion and exchange on the basis of this  compilation. In light of this, it was agreed to revert to this agenda item at  the next meeting of the Council so that these exchanges can continue, including  on the basis of the updatedSecretariat document of COVID-19  related IP measures.\nMembers discussed a request by Chad, on behalf of the LDC Group, to extend  the general transitional period for LDCs to implement the TRIPS Agreement. This exemption has been previously extended  on two occasions. On 29 November 2005, a TRIPS Council decision extended this  general transition period until 1 July 2013. Subsequently on 11 June 2013, the Council  renewed the transition period until 1 July 2021.\nArticle 66.1 of the TRIPS Agreementstates that in view of the special  needs and requirements of LDCs, their economic, financial and administrative  constraints, and their need for flexibility to create a viable technological  base, they shall not be required to apply the provisions of the Agreement for a  period that can be extended by the TRIPS Council upon a duly motivated request  by an LDC.\nChad noted  that the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the challenges that the LDCs  continue to face, such as lack of domestic financial resources, high debt  levels and fragile health systems, which can have far-reaching impacts on  education, human rights, employment, food security and economic development in  the long term.\nWhile a  majority of members supported in principle the extension of the transition  period for LDCs, others asked for more time to consult with their capital. The  chair suggested that the LDC Group consult with other members in order to provide  further explanations and to bridge differences as soon as possible given next  year's deadline.\nFollowing  up on past discussions on IP and innovation that have regularly been added to  the Council's agenda since 2012, the co-sponsors (Australia, Canada, Chile, the  European Union, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, Chinese Taipei, the United  Kingdom and the United States, with the support of South Korea) proposed to  discuss the topic of “Making MSMEs competitive through inclusive protection of  various IPRs”.\nThe  proponents underlined the key role MSMEs play in most economies as major  sources of innovation, industrial competitiveness and international trade. In  emerging markets, small companies, such as start-ups, are able to create  innovative products and services and to respond quickly to drastic changes in  technology and industrial structures. They also contribute to open innovation  through collaboration with large and medium-sized companies.\nHowever,  most MSMEs lack IP awareness, human and financial resources, and experience in  developing IP strategies as they do not comprehensively register their IP  rights. They also lack resources and experience in enforcing their IP rights  against infringement. In this context, the debate aimed to facilitate the  exchange of knowledge and experiences. Members shared examples of MSMEs developing  their business through building and achieving optimal exploitation of the  highest possible quality IP and on how governments can support MSMEs'  initiatives to expand their businesses by encouraging such IP portfolios.\nThe  Secretariat is planning to once again hold a workshop on the implementation of  Article 66.2 of the TRIPS Agreement regarding incentives for technology  transfer to LDCs early next year.Article 66.2 of the TRIPS Agreementcalls on developed countries to  provide incentives to enterprises and institutions in their territories for the  purpose of promoting and encouraging technology transfer to LDCs in order to  enable them to create a sound and viable technological base. The workshop will  once again comprise two days of sessions, and a reporting and review segment  within the first TRIPS Council meeting of 2021. Until then, members will have  time to assess the information provided by developed countries in their reports  and discuss the LDCs' proposal regarding the template for reporting on  commitments under this article.\nOn TRIPS  non-violation and situation complaints (NVSCs) — whether members should be able  to bring complaints where they consider that another member's action, or a  particular situation, has deprived them of an expected advantage under the  TRIPS Agreement, even though no obligation under the Agreement has been  violated - members reiterated their well-known positions. The chair encouraged  members to table submissions that can assist in shaping the discussion and  result in a meaningful outcome at the 12th Ministerial Conference scheduled  to be held in 2021. The Secretariat reported on the NVSCs briefing session held  on 3 September 2020, which provided information on the origin and application  of such complaints in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the WTO,  on the discussions in the context of the TRIPS Agreement and on NVSC provisions  in regional trade agreements. The briefing attracted over 90 participants  across the globe and received positive feedback.\nIn the  context of the annual review of the Special Compulsory Licensing System in  Article 31bis of the TRIPS Agreement, the Secretariat gave a presentation on the  steps to use the system.

A number of members highlighted how trade facilitation — and the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) in particular — can be used to help authorities ensure that essential goods related to COVID-19 treatments and equipment can cross borders and reach their intended recipients quickly.", "detail": "Several members made presentations during the committee meeting regarding  initiatives they have taken to facilitate trade during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The United States, Brazil, Colombia and Japan issued a joint call for  accelerated implementation of the TFA, arguing that cross-border  trade is a critical channel for getting essential products to those who need  them. The committee also reviewed more than 70 notifications from members  outlining steps taken or planned to implement provisions of the TFA.\nSri Lanka said its customs authorities have launched initiatives and  implemented mechanisms to ensure the smooth flow of essential medical supplies  and other commodities during the pandemic. This included tailoring cargo  inspection to ensure the release of medium and low risk cargo with minimum or  no customs intervention, issuing regulatory approvals in electronic format, and  establishing priority clearance procedures for consignments of relief goods.\nThe Dominican Republic noted that it had adopted temporary measures to  facilitate trade in response to the pandemic, including suspending import and  consumer taxes on hand sanitizer, personal protection equipment and other goods  as well as streamlining import and export procedures to clear high-priority  imports.\nThe European Union outlined how customs authorities have facilitated  compliance with rules of origin certification for the Pan-euro-Med Area by  issuing digitally signed confirmation letters and exchanging scanned  certificates electronically to overcome customs office lockdowns and other  restrictions during the pandemic.\nJapan said its authorities have responded to the pandemic by facilitating  customs clearance procedures and simplifying import/export declaration forms  for relief supplies. They have also granted flexibilities in timelines related  to the submission of certificates of origin and the payment of duties.\nCanada, on behalf of the Ottawa Group (Australia,  Brazil, Chile, European Union, Japan, Kenya, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand,  Norway, Singapore and Switzerland),  presented acompilationof trade facilitation measures  its  members have implemented over the past half-year in response to the COVID-19  outbreak. Canada said the group was  sharing these experiences to help identify ways to take full advantage  of the opportunities for trade facilitation in the TFA and to promote best  practices for the implementation of the Agreement.\nIn presenting ajoint communicationfrom the United States, Brazil, Colombia and (as a  late co-sponsor) Japan, US Ambassador to the WTO Dennis Shea said the WTO  “is not the forum for providing the health solutions to COVID-19, but it  is the forum for providing the roadmap for countries to access and trade  medical and health supplies and equipment across borders”.\n“Cross-border trade is a critical channel for getting essential  products to those who need them,” Mr Shea said, and the TFA can play a  critical role in keeping those goods moving across borders. The four sponsors  of the communication were not asking WTO members to take on any new commitments  but to accelerate implementation of TFA commitments where possible.\n“Now more than ever, it's time to work together, and keep our feet  on the gas,” Mr Shea declared.\nThe TFAentered into force on 22 February 2017. Developed members of the WTO committed to apply  the substantive portions of the TFA from the date it took effect.  Developing countries and least developed  countries (LDCs) were given flexibility to indicate which substantial  provisions they intended to apply immediately and which provisions would be  implemented following a transition period they themselves designate.\nThe four sponsors said ongoing TFA implementation is already resulting in  greater customs efficiency, more effective revenue collection, and better  access for small enterprises to new export opportunities. Measures designed to  improve transparency in customs practices, reduce documentary requirements and  allow for processing of documents before goods arrive have had an immediate  impact on traders, they added.\nA dozen members took the floor to comment, with many expressing their  support for the initiative and the importance of trade facilitation in ensuring  essential goods can cross borders quickly. One member emphasized the importance  of donor support in assisting members with implementation, while another said it  believed members themselves were best placed to determine when to implement their  commitments.\nThe WTO Secretariat provided an update on members' ratifications and  implementation of the TFA. Since the last committee meeting, four new  ratifications have been received (Tanzania, Vanuatu, Tunisia and Colombia),  bringing the total number of ratifications to 153 members, or 93% of the  membership.\nOverall, the rate of implementation of TFA commitments currently stands  at just over 66% for the entire WTO membership, the Secretariat said. Fifteen  developing country members have already achieved 100% implementation of the TFA.  Developed countries were required to ensure full implementation when the TFA  entered into force.\nRegarding LDCs, 27 members, or 84% of LDCs that have notified Category B  designations, have also notified definitive dates for the implementation of  their Category B commitments, while 25 members, or 75% of LDCs that have  already notified Catetory C designations, have also notified the definitive  dates for the implementation of their Category C commitments.\nUnder the TFA, Category B covers TFA provisions that developing countries  and LDCs will implement over transition periods determined by them and set out  in notifications to the WTO. Category C covers TFA provisions that developing  countries and LDCs will implement over transition periods determined by them  and set out in notifications to the WTO, and which require capacity building  support in order to help implement the commitments.\nCategory A covers commitments that members agreed to implement when the  TFA entered into force.\nMembers met on 21 October to review  progress in the provision of support and assistance for capacity building to support  implementation of the TFA, exchange information on implementation problems, and  share experiences on ongoing assistance and support.  Presentations made at the dedicated session  are availablehere.\nThe committee will hold its 2021 meetings on 2-3  March, 27-28 July and 19-21 October.\nConcluded at the WTO's 2013  Bali Ministerial Conference, the TFA  contains provisions for expediting the movement, release and clearance of  goods, including goods in transit. It also sets out measures for effective  cooperation between customs and other appropriate authorities on trade  facilitation and customs compliance issues. It further contains provisions for  technical assistance and capacity building in this area.\nThe TFA broke new ground for developing and least-developed countries in  the way it will be implemented. For the first time in WTO history, the  requirement to implement the Agreement was directly linked to the capacity of  the country to do so. In addition, the Agreement states that assistance and  support should be provided to help them achieve that capacity.\nMore information on trade facilitation and the TFA is availablehere.\n"},

They argued that the liberalization of agriculture-related services  would help mitigate the health, economic and social challenges arising from the  COVID-19 pandemic, notably by reducing bottlenecks in food value chains and  strengthening the resilience of food systems across the world.\nIn their communication, the co-sponsors  expressed interest in better GATS commitments in the following services  sub-sectors as most relevant for agriculture: services incidental to  agriculture; hunting and forestry; veterinary services; commission agents'  services; wholesale trade services; and retailing services.\nSeveral members intervened and provided their  views on the two communications.

These two sectors make up 43% of services trade. The drop  in transport matches declines recorded during the financial crisis (-29%), but the  underlying reasons are different. Unlike in 2009, the decrease in transport  services trade is driven predominantly by restrictions to passenger transport and  a fall in global demand for international travel, not by sharp declines in freight  shipping.\nSource: WTO estimates based on WTO-UNCTAD-ITC data.\nOther  services were affected unevenly by the pandemic. Sectors requiring physical  proximity fell steeply such as construction (-25%) and audio-visual, artistic and  recreational services (-14%). Architectural and engineering  services, closely linked with construction, and other business services were also  down 11%. Contract manufacturing services also collapsed (-22%), with factory production  halting in many countries. Uncertainty about the economic context also had an  impact on research and development (R&D) services, with exports from this  sector declining 8% in the United States and 11% in the European Union.\nFinancial  services were only marginally affected, emphasizing the very different nature  of this crisis from the financial crisis, when exports dropped by 20% in the  first quarter of 2009. Recent growth in this sector is even understated due to the  dollar appreciation. For example, intra-EU trade in financial services rose by 2%  in euro terms, while it stagnated in dollar terms.\nComputer  services, the fastest growing services sector in the last decade, was the only  one to record an increase in exports, which was up 4% due to the rising demand  for digitalization.

Deputy Director-General Yi Xiaozhun provided  opening remarks to mark the launch of the new platform, recalling that theAgreement on Import Licensing  Proceduresis one of the oldest agreements in the history of the  WTO and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). He highlighted that its  establishment dates back to the Tokyo Round of trade negotiations (1973–79).\nDDG Yi stressed that as one of the most frequently used trade policy instruments  applied by almost all governments, the use of import licensing has extended  from enforcing quantitative restrictions and collecting trade statistics to  safeguarding product quality, the environment, consumer welfare, public health and  national security.\n\"Transparency makes trade more inclusive and predictable. Enhanced  efficiency, achieved through easy access to information, further reduces trade  costs of both exporters and importers. I fully believe that the new WTO import  licensing database will significantly improve transparency in this important  field and will benefit all members, especially those developing members who  have capacity and resource constraints, as well as SMEs and MSMEs,\" DDG Yi  said. Read hisfull  statement.\nThe new database is a comprehensive information centre containing all  members' legislation, procedures and product information relating to import  licensing. Offering a user-friendly interface, the platform will allow members  and the business community to find import licensing information more  efficiently and to make better use of the information contained in members' notifications.\nWith the technical support of the WTO's Information Technology Solutions  Division (ITSD), staff at the Market Access Division designed the structure of  the new platform, reviewed and analyzed all import licensing notifications  submitted by members since 1995 and uploaded profiles of 134 members. They also  verified over 2,500 pieces of legislation to make sure all links lead to the  relevant information and to ensure accuracy regarding more than 1,000 products  and procedures.\nMembers took the floor to congratulate the Secretariat for the hard work  in creating the database and noted that the new platform will be a valuable  contribution to the Committee's activities. It will also promote compliance  with WTO members' transparency obligations. This will be especially helpful for  developing countries which have capacity constraints. Many members emphasized  that the database is a powerful example of how WTO members can improve  transparency in a way that also assists importers and exporters.\nThe platform can be accessedhere.\nImport licences are permits granted before a product is imported. The  administrative procedures for obtaining the licences should be simple, neutral,  equitable and transparent. Where possible they should be given automatically  and quickly, and even if they are non-automatic, they should not obstruct trade  unnecessarily.\n"},

You've done a great  job!\nEnvironmental  issues are woven into the history of the multilateral trading system.\nBut the role of  trade and the WTO on the environment is complex, and as a result, it is not  always well understood.\nIs trade good or  bad for the environment? Does the WTO prevent governments from protecting the  environment? How can the WTO support its Members' efforts to green their  economies?\nThese are very important  questions which deserve our close attention. Not least because they are linked  with broader efforts to restore confidence in:\nThe debate on trade  and the environment is likely to become even more prominent in the years ahead.\nOne big reason is  the COVID-19 crisis, which has made very clear how nature, human health and the  economy are intimately connected.\nMany have argued  that environmental degradation, such as biodiversity and habitat loss and  climate change will make potential zoonotic outbreaks like COVID-19 more common  in the future. Others have noted the disruptions to our lives from the  pandemics might be a sign of what is to be expected in a climate affected  future.\nThe backlash from  nature is all around us, from wildfires and droughts to hurricanes and floods.\nCalls for ambitious  action to safeguard our environment, especially from young people, are growing  louder by the day.\nAt the same time,  the pandemic has put huge additional strains on the global trading system — in  fact, on the whole global economy.\nTrade tensions are  on the rise and continued escalation risks having a major economic impact.\nHow we respond will  be crucial because a strong and effective global trading system needs to be a  key part of the global response to the pandemic and efforts to build back greener  and better.\nThe short answers  to the big questions in the booklet that we are launching today serve as  signposts that can guide us on the road towards a WTO that works better for  people, planet and prosperity in the 21st century.\nI would like to  highlight three key signposts that are outlined in the booklet.\nThe booklet reminds  us that governments already use trade measures to achieve environmental goals.\nExamples of  measures include preferential tariffs for green goods, energy efficiency  requirements for household products, licensing schemes to limit trade in  endangered animals and plants, taxes on hazardous chemicals and incentives  schemes for low-carbon technologies.\nWhat's more, our  data here at the WTO show that this trend has been intensifying over time.\nToday, almost 1 in  6 notifications of trade measures to the WTO is about measures related to the  environment, compared with 1 in 12 when the WTO was created 25 years ago.\nSo we cannot shy  away from the debate on trade and environmental sustainability.\nThere is a  responsibility that must be borne by the whole international policy community  to listen to concerns, find solutions and facilitate collaboration not just among  governments, but also consumers, the private sector and other stakeholders.\nThe idea of today's  publication can be traced back to the 2018 event that kicked-off the WTO and  UNEP partnership.  WTO and UNEP have joined  forces to provide a platform for interested stakeholders from all sectors of  society to exchange ideas, showcase successful experiences and improve  understanding of how trade can more effectively help bring about sustainable  development.\nThe booklet distils  the complex legal questions that have arisen in some environment-related WTO  cases into a few key considerations:\nThis is one of the key  contributions of the booklet, to correct  serious misperceptions about the implications  of WTO rules for environmental action.\nAs the booklet  notes, the impact of trade-opening on the environment is complex and depends on  many factors.\nHowever, closing  off trade would not necessarily result in a better environment.\nWhat matters from  an environmental perspective is not whether goods and their components cross  national borders to reach the final consumer.   What matters instead is the environmental impact of those goods at every  stage of their life cycle, from production and packaging to transport, use and  disposal.\nWe may achieve a  better environmental outcome by producing goods wherever it is most  environmentally efficient to do so and allowing trade to match global supply  and demand.\nThis requires trade  approaches that pull us in the direction of sustainability.\nA growing number of  WTO members recognize this reality.\nWe have seen a  marked increase in the level of engagement in the Committee on Trade and  Environment, a unique forum dedicated to enhancing our dialogue on trade and  environment issues.\nPartly as a result,  we have also seen the rise of coalitions around specific environmental topics such  as the circular economy, plastic pollution, fossil fuel subsidy reform and clean  technologies.\nThis is the right  way to go, because trade policies have a huge potential to support  sustainability.\nThe current crisis  calls for a collective response on trade that fosters sustainability,  inclusiveness and resilience.\nThe WTO Secretariat  is here to support WTO members in their search for flexible, creative and  pragmatic solutions.\nThe booklet that we  are releasing today is an effort in this direction.\nThank you all for  joining us. I look forward to the discussion.\n"},

I have  been a junior team member.  I have also  been on the outside, not directly part of the negotiation but seeking to  influence the outcome of a negotiation.   And I have been a cheerleader, urging a coalescing of views to bring about  progress for the common good.  Some  results have been very good — those shine a bit brighter in memory.  Some were not, often due to circumstances and  sometimes due to pilot error.  They also stand  out in memory and are a cause for occasionally mulling over what might have  been done differently.\nMy principal mentor in the art of negotiation,  the US Trade Representative Robert S. Strauss, was a person who had no intrinsic  interest in the substance of what was being negotiated.  That sounds harsh, but I can assure you that  he was not wed to one tariff cutting formula over another for the beauty of the  algebra.  He wanted to know what the U.S.  needed and had to figure out what could be sold.   He  could walk into a room and transform the reality of being stuck in the mud and  not going anywhere, to a position where those present were aligned with getting  to a positive outcome.  He would say,  perhaps accurately, that he had made a career of turning junk into machinery  and sometimes machinery into junk.  I  only saw the first of these two categories.\nSometime there was no success — such as when  he as assigned to solve the Arab-Israel impasse or to whip inflation.  These were tasks at which he did not succeed  but he left those subjects no worse off.\nWhat makes for a successful  negotiator is probably, for most of us, experience.  Experience is needed to avoid making  mistakes.  Making mistakes may be the  only way of gaining experience.\nWhat follows is an outline of the  elements of negotiating skills based on my own experience, which may not suit  all situations or individuals.  Over five  decades in negotiations in various settings, one would hope to have learned  something.  But human experience  indicates that this is not always the case.\nThe result I wish convey succinctly  can be summed up in ten points:\nFirst:Understanding  the framework for analysis.\nIn preparation for an international  trade negotiation, there are always three categories of analyses — the facts,  the economics, and the rules.  In a  domestic setting, substitute “law” for “rules” to determine what is  feasible.\nSecond:Setting the objective.\nYogi  Berra, the famous American baseball player and even more famous phrase-mangling  epigrammist, said “If you don't know where you are going, you'll end up  someplace else.”\nSetting  the objective may seem like a straight-forward enough requirement, but it is  not.  To be useful the objective must be  actually serve one’s interests.  It  requires an inquiry into what happens if one is successful.  A former law partner of mine often said that  dogs chase cars but would not know what they would do with one if they caught it.\nAlso worth asking: What the cost  is likely to be in achieving success?   What opportunities were foregone?   What is the cost of failure?\nWhat else do you need to know?\nThird:Identifying your own interests and parameters\nIn 1858, in a famous speech, made  before he was President, Abraham Lincoln said ““If we could first know where we are, and  whither we are tending, we could then better judge what  to do, and how to do it …”\nKnowing the facts is vitally  important.  Without that knowledge, you  are sailing without a working compass or GPS.   Government officials may assume from statistics that they are pretty  clear on what the facts are.  This is usually  not the case.  In valuing a trade  concession to be obtained or granted, it is imperative to know not only how  competitive your own industry is, but what the trend is likely to be.  You have to be like a successful hedge fund  manager.  Undervaluing a concession, to  be granted or received, is all too easy to do.   To do so undermines the value of the deal.  Prescience is not available.  The next best thing is to consult with those  who really know the market to be found in the relevant industry (including, of  course, agriculture).  Those engaged in  commerce are investing or disinvesting based on their best judgment of where  demand is headed.\nWith a fair amount of knowledge of the facts,  one can understand if a concession you are about to give may be overvalued by  the other party to the negotiation and therefore swapped for something with  greater potential value.  The U.S. was  able to give up a major form of protection for Scotch whiskey because we knew  that consumer taste at the time was shifting to white goods — gin and  vodka.  To the U.K., removing that perversely  creative American trade barrier was a long-term objective, to which it was very  strongly attached.\nSetting a value is not just an objective  exercise, it is also subjective.  One  British official told me, when I mentioned the UK Treasury estimate of the cost  to Britain of future economic growth, that the prime motivation for Brexit was  not economic, but to regain a greater measure of sovereignty.  Imprecise elements, some psychological, which  in this case means political, color any major international negotiation.  These negotiations always have unquantifiable  elements.\nWhen the Congress in granting a  trade negotiating mandate to the President added a complicated private sector  advisory structure made up of no less than 45 committees, we in the U.S. Executive  Branch were appalled.  We thought it  would be an excessive burden.  We were  wrong.  The committees were a source of  immense strength not only in helping us know what to give and what not to give  at the bargaining table, but those who participated as advisors became supporters  for approval and implementation of the negotiated results.  The outcome in Congress was a vote of 395-7  in the House of Representatives and 90-4 in the Senate — a result never before  achieved and probably one that never will be exactly equaled.  This favorable vote was due in no small part  to the negotiators understanding U.S. commercial interests.  Acting on this knowledge can and did garner  political support.  For those who might  have been hostile and who might have worked against approval of the trade  agreements, engagement in the advisory process was in part responsible for  obtaining at least acquiescence in the result.   U.S. history is littered with trade agreements signed and not  implemented, a failure often if not always caused by miscalculation.  Getting the politics wrong is as bad as  getting the substance wrong, and the two are often closely related.\nIt is also imperative to know your  negotiating limits.  You can lead  domestic opinion, but you cannot succeed if you flout it.  I got a call from a representative of the  Congressional Black Caucus one day during the Tokyo Round.  It turned out that the Government Procurement  Code was going to eliminate the small business set-aside, something unnoticed  up until that point, at least at a political level.  What was involved in the set-aside was the  ability of largely minority businesses to participate in government  contracts.  I called my opposite number  in the European Communities (the EU’s predecessor arrangement ) and said, “you  don’t need this as part of the agreement and we cannot give it, so it is off  the table”.  The reply “No problem.”  We each new the value of the US offer and  what could and could not be done.\nThe bottom line, it was great to  receive that call before the cake was baked.   Afterwards it could have killed the whole negotiating Round.\nFourth:Understanding  the other side’s interests\nKnowing the other side’s interests is  a simple enough requirement but it is often ignored.  The other side’s interests are not  necessarily easy to ascertain.  It is  hard to stand in someone else’s shoes.   How do they view the trade-offs?   What are their economic and political interests?  Do they need something as a priority that is  not impossible to give them?  It would be  good to know that to avoid a deadlock later in the process.  To get the Tokyo Round concluded, it was  necessary for the U.S. to pledge that it was not out to try to destroy the  Common Agricultural Policy (the CAP).\nOverreach: Getting more in an agreement than  the other side can deliver leads mostly to default and disappointment.  It is imperative to know the other side’s  actual limits, beyond which either no deal is possible as the costs for either  side are too great.  That is the extreme  case.  More usually the cost of failure  to know enough about the other side consists of not having a clear picture of  where the substance of a possible deal is to be found.\nFifth:Level of ambition\nThe word “ambition” came to be overused in  connection with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) but it was worth having as  a concept.  At the start of a  negotiation, a Venn diagram might show no overlap, so no deal would be possible.  But with political will, the limits on either  side can be stretched (not broken).  It  is necessary for each side often to be able to go beyond existing instructions,  particularly because those who issue instructions are not usually at the  negotiating table.  In the military,  avoiding this trap is reason for the doctrine known asmission command.  The invention of the doctrine is attributed  to both Prussia and Napoleon.  The  doctrine\ncombines centralized intent with decentralized  execution… and promotes freedom and speed of action, and initiative,  within defined constraints. Subordinates, understanding the commander's  intentions, their own missions and the context of those missions, are told what  effect they are to achieve and the reason why it needs to be achieved. They  then decide within their delegated freedom of action how best to achieve their  missions.(i)\nWhile  stretching to achieve an outcome, as noted, one needs to clearly understand  one’s own actual limits.  It may or may  not be useful for the other side to know your limits.\nAn  objective set too high will be either unobtainable or fall afoul of the other  problems already mentioned.  Set too low,  it may not be worth the effort and may foreclose coming back to the table for a  more ambitious outcome.  If the perfect  is the enemy of the good, so also may be the inadequate.\nAmbition  also raises a question about the shape of a negotiation.  There are two schools of thought on this,  dealt with a bit later in these remarks.\nSixth:Pragmatism and  idealism\nWhen I was in the U.S. government, an  assignment that I received was to negotiate quotas on imports of specialty  steels (various types of stainless steel and allow tool steel) as a result of a  safeguard action in which the President had decided to grant relief.  The Swedish negotiators would not agree to  limit Sweden’s exports to the United States as a matter of principle.  So Swedish exports were put into a basket  quota with other non-signatories, entry of imports into the United States to be  on first-come first-served.  This could  not be good for Swedish exports.  The  Swedish government chose to act on principle, but it may have been tinged with  pragmatism.  It presumably did not want  to have the precedent set of agreeing to export restrictions.  Maybe this was for the best longer term for  Sweden even though it was not at that moment the best commercial outcome for  Swedish industry.\nAnother example comes to mind: When I was  negotiating to try to get access to the Japanese market for a product that was  very politically sensitive for Japan, I was offered market access for all of  the product that could be incorporated into products solely for export to the  United States — that is the American product would not be allowed to stay in  Japan.  My idealism and ignorance guided  me to reject the deal and settle for a (small) import quota.  The principle that nothing that the United  States producers sold could remain in Japan was infuriating.\nAt that time, Japan had held that American skis  were not suitable for Japanese snow and that American aluminum baseball bats  made the wrong sound, and neither should be imported.  My reaction was in the circumstances understandable,  but my objection was to no great purpose.   What was unknown to me and perhaps to the Japanese side was that  Japanese exports including the U.S. component were going to skyrocket.  Was that foreseeable?  I very much doubt it, but I did not do enough  research to see experts on the American industry thought this would happen.  Emotions can cloud judgment and can be especially  costly when the principle involved is not worth defending.\nPragmatism is also a casualty if one nit-picks.   It is called having an eye for the capillary  as opposed to going after the main objective, the jugular.  There are many other metaphors, “not seeing  the forest for the trees” is another.   The lesson to be learned, steer away from the nonessentials; do not get  distracted by minutia.  In my earliest  years my penchant for correcting syntax in negotiating texts was a frivolous  misdirection of energy (a fault which I have not fully overcome).  A corollary: avoid annoying counterparties  with little purpose.\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the pursuit  of principle that serves core national objectives.  Every multilateral negotiation should have an  element of sustaining and improving the multilateral trading system itself.  It is necessary to nurture the public good,  because the endurance, health and expansion of the global trading system are  vitally important to all WTO Members, including very much for the United States.\nLip service to multilateralism is not enough.  Deeds are needed.  The whole of the deal, the result of a major  international negotiation, is worth much more than any of its parts.\nIt is necessary for all WTO Members without  exception to make a positive net contribution. Each can do so consistent with  its capabilities, even the least developed and the most vulnerable.  The system is robust, but only with a common  agreement that it must remain so, with actions to match.\nSeventh:Leverage\nTraditionally, this is achieved through trading  stock, concessions desired by others in return for concessions received.  Of course, the WTO is not hermetically sealed  off from its Members’ other interests.   However, the organization of governments is usually not so perfect as to  allow concessions under the control of non-trade ministries to be granted in  trade negotiations.  Leverage may take  the form of a legal right.  Then there  can be WTO litigation or a negotiated settlement or both.\nIn the WTO, leverage can take the form of a  threatened or actual veto, as long as the practice that all decisions must be  taken by consensus is maintained.  And I  have not heard any Member say that it wanted the organization to operate on  another basis.\nIn a safeguard action or unilateral  threat of trade restrictions, the leverage can be the threatened or imposed trade  measure.  The leverage involved is the  power to control the market.\nLeverage  can take the form of public opinion or peer pressure in some cases.\nA  substitute for leverage is a shared belief in conducting one’s policies and  actions in a manner that supports the global trading system.  If there is no or little common systemic interest,  what is left to drive a negotiation is narrower, the value of concessions to be  granted and received, or economic or political power.\nEighth:Demeanor\nBeing tough may be required by  the circumstances.  Being obnoxious is  likely to be counterproductive.  Even if  one’s leverage is overwhelming, the deal will likely not be as good as if there  had been more cooperation.  Losing the  respect of one’s opposite number across the negotiating table or simply being  irritating is likely to have costs for you that may not be apparent.\nMost of what I have spoken of here today and  experienced over time has concerned dealing with one other negotiating  partner.  I have also experienced  multi-party negotiations in several roles, as an advisor to the U.S.  government, as someone seeking to promote particular specific outcomes in TPP  and the Uruguay Round, as the first chairman of the OECD Steel Committee, by  chairing the Trade Policy Review Group (the highest level of the U.S.  government for coordinating US trade policy in detail), by chairing committees  on comparative innovation policy at the US National Academies, by co-chairing  events for the National Academies with China and with delegations from other  countries, and most recently as a draftsman moving a text forward to an agreed  conclusion.\nBeing a scribe and being a chair are roles that  have some common characteristics.  Holding  the pen or holding the gavel is very useful.   One has to be neutral as among parties but not as to whether there are  results.  For obtaining results, one has  to be a dedicated partisan.  One has to  be very sensitive to what is taking place in the room and in the corridors  outside the room.  One has to pull back  when insuperable obstacles are encountered and find other paths forward.  It is at times two steps forward and one step  back.\nThere is a premium on attitude, that the effort  is worth undertaking and that success with sufficient investment of effort is  possible.  The chief skill is, perhaps, the  ability to listen very carefully to all the parties to find common ground.  One does not have the luxury of researching  each party’s objectives and limits.  One  is relying on instinct and what you learn from other parties in the  process.  Hearing what is said and  interpreting it, one can adjust the common draft.  This is what took place with a project called  regional support in the global semiconductor industry.\nSemiconductors have been called the crude oil  of the information age, oil having given us the use of internal combustion  engines and fuel for the prior industrial age.   Computer chips provide the basis for communication and computing.  They are as essential to the global economy  today as oil had been.  Annual sales of  the global industry amount to about $422 billion according to the most recent monthly  data.  It is truly a global industry,  with chips designed in one location, “fabbed” (short for fabricated,  manufactured) in another, tested elsewhere, imbedded in some other place, and  shipped as part of electronic equipment to every country.  It was my good fortune to have been counsel  to the U.S. semiconductor industry association for all of the part of my career  spent in private law practice spanning nearly four decades.\nOne of the global industry’s concerns in recent  years has been government-led  industrial policies aimed at promoting domestic semiconductor sectors.  Two  parallel fora have been discussing the issue, one at the level of industry CEOs  in the World Semiconductor Council (WSC), and the other at the level of  officials in the Government and Authorities Meeting on Semiconductors  (GAMS).  In October 2017.  Agreement was reached at the 18th annual Governments/Authorities  Meeting on Semiconductors (GAMS) held in Busan, South Korea from Oct. 30-Nov.  2.\nWhat is remarkable about the agreement is that it  addresses one of the most difficult current areas of concern in international  trade today, and that it was supported by China, the United States, Chinese  Taipei, Korea, Japan and the European Union.    This is how the Agreement has been described:\nIn its statement in support of the regional support guidelines  and practices, the GAMS highlighted that regional support programs should be  “guided by the principles of openness, transparency, inclusiveness,  non-discrimination, and respect WTO rules.” It further noted “government action  should be guided by market-based principles, and that competitiveness of  companies and their products, not the intervention of governments and  authorities, should be the principal driver of innovation, industrial success,  and international trade.”(ii)\nThe  existence of the agreement among this set of countries competing vigorously in  this sector demonstrates that it is possible to agree on a very sensitive  issue.\nLesson: Among other things,  perseverance is an essential ingredient in obtaining a successful outcome in negotiations.\nNinth:The shape of the deal\nHarking  back again to a bygone era of negotiating rounds, the driving force was the  size of what was on offer.  The larger  the pot of chips in a poker game, the harder it is to leave the table.  It is not clear whether that works today in  the multilateral trading system.   Multiple simultaneous negotiations are burdensome and complex. There can  be hostage taking, tying up everything.   Nevertheless, trade-offs are more possible if  there is more than one area being negotiated.   A net positive balance for any party in one agreement can offset a net  negative balance in another agreement.\nThe  opposite school of thought is that many agreements negotiated at once and  linked leads to hostage taking and no results.   In an age of self-absorption, nationalism and populism, the common good  may be lost sight of.  The absence of a largely  benevolent hegemon makes a larger negotiating package of agreements something  of a rubix cube which has been dipped in super-glue.(1)\nTenth:Perseverance\nBelief that no agreement is possible  is self-defeating.  Realism is needed but  in a measured way.  Thestatus quowas not pre-ordained, it just happened.   Pessimism is infectious, but so is optimism.  I have seen a leader walk into a room and  change the dynamic.  It is rare but not  unknown.  Some limits are imposed by the  context, at home and internationally, but the worst limits are those that are  self-imposed.  It would take supernatural  luck for pessimism to ever accomplish anything.   A full dose of optimism, with a dotted line connection to reality, is  needed.\nEveryone who seeks to be a negotiator  should look in the mirror and ask that image “why are you here?  If not now, when?  If not me, who?”\nCreativity is needed.  Negotiations reach apparent impasses for  which alternative solutions are needed.  Defeatism  (being excessively “realistic”) is not an approach likely to lead to success.\nThere cannot be 100% clarity in  making negotiating decisions.  Risks need  to be taken.  Where there is little or no  risk-taking, there are limited or no results.   Bureaucrats are characterized as being risk averse.  Negotiators cannot be.  Often a political level needs to be brought  in to get through seeming impasses.  That  is one reason why there is a need for involving the political level.  Those who issue instructions can more easily  amend them, go beyond them.\nParticipants need to be taken out of their  comfort zones, which have proved to get them nowhere.  Often it is the political level that is  needed to close the gap at the end.  It  is also the field commanders, the negotiators, who need to exceed their instructions  to move to a deal.  If you were right,  you are a hero.  If not, well, perhaps  the next time.  Often enough, it is  self-imposed limitations rather than external ones that impair a negotiator’s ability to reach  desired results.\n"},

The Negotiating Group Chair,  Ambassador Santiago Wills of Colombia, had introduced the draft text in June  and members in July agreed to use it as the starting point for text-based work to  develop new disciplines on fisheries subsidies to prohibit subsidies that go to  IUU fishing or contribute to overfishing and overcapacity.\nThe  chair reported the latest progress to heads of WTO delegations at the closing  meeting of the week, where members also commented on how to further organize the  negotiating process. The chair said he was encouraged by the constructive  discussions and new textual suggestions. He noted, however, that progress was  slow and he urged members to pick up the pace.

The note provides an overview of IP-related measures taken by WTO members and other stakeholders since the start of the crisis.", "detail": "The paper highlights  that theWTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of  Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)represents the most comprehensive multilateral agreement on IP, and  provides a framework in which much-needed innovation in relation to COVID-19  can be encouraged, shared and disseminated, while balancing rights and  obligations.\nUnder this framework,  the way in which the global IP system is designed and implemented can be a  significant factor in facilitating access to existing technologies and in  supporting the creation, manufacturing and dissemination of new technologies. This  includes access to protective equipment, contact tracing software, diagnostics,  as well as vaccines and treatments yet to be developed which will be fundamental  to effectively respond to the COVID-19 crisis.\nThe IP system can  also support collaboration and cooperation among health technology developers,  governments and other stakeholders, and the implementation of a number of initiatives  addressing the voluntary sharing and pooling of IP rights (IPRs), thus  responding to the spirit of collaboration that is required for the global  effort to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe report points to the  range of policy options available under the TRIPS Agreement to deal with public  health issues, such as compulsory licensing and government use of a patent  without the authorization of its owner under a number of conditions aimed at  protecting the legitimate interests of the patent holder. It underscores that  the response to the COVID-19 pandemic has led national and regional IP offices  to take initiatives to expedite or simplify their administration of the IP  system, especially concerning patents and trademarks, and to provide practical  support for firms seeking to develop products of potential benefit in combating  the pandemic.\nWhile much public  health policy attention has focused on the patent system as a key element of  the system for innovation and dissemination of medical technologies, the report  notes that other areas of IP covered by the TRIPS Agreement are also significant,  such as the protection of trade secrets and clinical trial data, a well-run  trademark system and a balanced copyright system that takes due account of the  interests of rights holders and the public to access copyright-protected works.\nThe note recognizes  that facilitating up-to-date information and maximum transparency on legal and  policy measures taken in the field of IP in response to the pandemic is in the  mutual interest of all stakeholders. The aim is supporting governments and  economic operators to keep abreast in a rapidly evolving trade landscape as  well as to promote much-needed clarity and enable mutual learning.\nThe paper is intended  to provide a factual background resource for members and to serve as a  reference for use in practical technical assistance activities. Updated lists  of IP measures undertaken by governments in the context of COVID-19 are  available on the WTO'sCOVID-19 webpageand theWIPO COVID-19 IP Policy Tracker.\nThe report can be foundhere.\n"}
