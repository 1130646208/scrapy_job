", "detail": "22 May 2017, Juba, South Sudan – The United Nations Institute of Training and Research (UNITAR) Hiroshima Office and the Embassy of Japan in South Sudan launched the 3rd Cycle of UNITAR South Sudan Fellowship Programme. Focusing on project management, leadership and entrepreneurship skills, the six-month capacity-building training programme offers scholarship to 25 South Sudanese Fellows and coaches from public sector, private sector, academic institutions, and civil society organisations. \nThe programme consists of four workshops—two in Juba and two others internationally. Designed for junior to mid-career level South Sudanese professionals, social entrepreneurship is the main theme of this year’s programme. The majority of the South Sudan’s population are youth; therefore, providing them with the entrepreneurial skills and insight to identify business opportunities, to lead, and to develop projects that will address the specific needs of their communities, and creates employment opportunities for youth, is critical. The Fellowship’s capacity building scheme facilitates development of entrepreneurial initiatives of private sector, especially small and medium enterprises, and contributes to stable economic prosperity of South Sudan in the long run. Such business development initiatives can also serve to generate income for the unemployed and thus reduce aid dependency. \nOn 15 May 2017, a ceremony was held in Juba to conclude the 2016 Cycle and to launch the 2017 Cycle of the programme. A number of key guests from the Government of South Sudan and international organizations, as well as UNITAR Alumni from the 2015 Cycle, witnessed the Fellows present their final project proposals. The total number of UNITAR Alumni in South Sudan now stands at 50, representing 34 different governmental and non-governmental organizations.\nDuring the ceremony, the Honourable Gathoth Gatkuoth Hothnyang, Minister of Labour, Public Service and Human Resource Development, stated, “We are grateful to the people of Japan for their tireless support to the people of South Sudan through this Fellowship programme. More than 60% of the population is youth, and we believe that human development is crucial for the Republic of South Sudan to maintain peace and embrace development. We believe that training Fellows in needs assessment and project proposal writing will reduce the need to hire foreign consultants, and allow the Fellows to be change agents in our various institutions.” \n“South Sudan Fellowship Programme presents great opportunities for young professionals from diverse backgrounds to work together for a common goal, which is to create a better future for South Sudan. Building friendship and trust is essential for their personal and professional lives, and in the long run, will contribute significantly to nation building,” said Mihoko Kumamoto, Head of the UNITAR Hiroshima Office. \nKiya Masahiko, Ambassador of Japan to South Sudan, noted: “The Government and the people of Japan are behind the self-help efforts of the people of South Sudan to achieve sustainable peace and development. As a nation that rose from the devastation of war, Japan is eager to see peace take root in South Sudan by the people’s leadership and ownership galvanized through this Japan-UNITAR Hiroshima project. The Government of Japan, a strong advocate of global peace and development, is committed to supporting the South Sudanese people through a range of humanitarian, development and peacebuilding projects, including through UNITAR Hiroshima.”\nThe programme is being coordinated with the support of the Government of the Republic of South Sudan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation is the political focal point for the programme, and the Ministry of Labour, Public Service and Human Resource Development is the operational focal point.\nAt UNITAR Hiroshima Office\n\nShamsul Hadi SHAMS (Dr.)\n\nE-mail: \nshamsul.shams@unitar.org\n\nPhone: +81 82 511 2424\nAt Embassy of Japan in South Sudan\n\nKoji Ito (Mr.)\n\nE-mail:  \nkoji.ito-2@mofa.go.jp\n\nPhone: +211 956 481 145\n"},

Focusing on project development and implementation, this year’s Fellowship trained 30 South Sudanese Fellows and Coaches, including 13 women, from the public sector, private sector, academic institutions, and civil society organizations. \nWorkshop II was held in Hiroshima and Tokyo, Japan between 12 – 17 February, and linked the needs assessment, which Fellows completed following Workshop I, with project planning and implementation training. In the week leading up to the workshop, UNITAR conducted an online training session on developing problem statements, and H.E. Kiya Masahiko, Japanese Ambassador to South Sudan, addressed the group in Juba.\nOn their first day in Hiroshima, Fellows and Coaches visited the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. Fellows said they were struck by the beauty of present-day Hiroshima, which recovered in a relatively short period of time from the tragedy of the world’s first atomic bombing. \nOver the course of the workshop, Fellows used the Results Chain, which allowed Fellows to see both the societal impact of a project, as well as the practical steps necessary to carry out a project. Fellows worked together to refine their problem statements and develop impact statements, which describe why a given project proposal is vital to an organization and community. Other lessons included an overview of the Business Model Canvas, which Fellows can use as an alternative tool in developing their projects, and a history lesson on Japan’s post-war recovery. \nDuring their last day in Japan, the group travelled to Tokyo to call on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose generous support makes this programme possible. \nJoshua Franco Paul of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of the Republic of South Sudan said, “Capacity building is one of the key elements to implementing the peace agreement signed in August 2016.  I am confident that the Fellows, with the knowledge and skills gained from UNITAR and their experience in Japan, will transform South Sudan’s institutions and greatly improve the delivery of services to all in the Republic of South Sudan.”\nTherezine Filbert Eugenio Sangu, Acting Director General for Human Resource Development of South Sudan’s Ministry of Labour, Public Service, and Human Resource Development stated, “The Fellows who have graduated from UNITAR’s South Sudan Fellowship Programme in 2015 are already performing at higher levels.  I am optimistic that governmental and other institutions in South Sudan will experience a positive impact from this Fellowship program.”\nUNITAR Hiroshima Office Head Mihoko Kumamoto remarked, “South Sudan continues to face severe challenges. Our training programme aims to build the future leaders of South Sudan. The Fellows, both men and women, are young professionals and come from diverse backgrounds. They have a common dream, which is to build a peaceful country that respects people and the environment and gives hope. The Fellows learned a set of skills critical to providing basic services. They also learned one model of reconstruction from Hiroshima. It is an honour to support these young professionals to realize their dream.\"\nJapanese Ambassador to South Sudan, Kiya Masahiko, expressed: \"Japanese people remember how Hiroshima was restored by the united efforts of survivors of the disastrous war 72 years ago. The Fellows, who were selected from frontrunners in South Sudan's reconstruction and development scenes, were inspired by their experience in and visits to Hiroshima and Japan at large. I strongly wish that the Fellows, with their renewed passion, will greatly contribute to South Sudan's peace and prosperity.\"\nSameul Ngor Ali Malou, a Fellow who participated in Workshop II, commented: “Japan and South Sudan have been good friends for many years and this relationship is further strengthened by the deployment of Japanese engineers and medical personnel to South Sudan for Peacekeeping Missions, helping in reconstruction projects, which include roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. On the same token, I am a Senior Inspector for the Ministry of Roads and Bridges, and have been given such a special opportunity to receive training through the UNITAR South Sudan Fellowship Programme as a means of contributing to the human resources development of our new nation of South Sudan. During the 6-month-long training, we have been equipped with the necessary knowledge and technical skills to support the country in various fields. Through traveling to Hiroshima for further training, we have enjoyed Japanese food, traditions and culture, and its natural beauty during our stay in Japan. These experiences and skills we have gained will inevitably have direct positive impacts in the development of our country.”\nThe UNITAR South Sudan Fellowship Programme was developed by UNITAR, with funding support from the Government of Japan, and with institutional support from the Government of the Republic of South Sudan, to cultivate the social entrepreneurship and project-development knowledge, skills, and attitudes of selected South Sudanese professionals. The Fellowship features a blended learning methodology and includes asynchronous and online training, coupled with two international workshops. Each workshop is linked by participant-led projects examining challenges and opportunities as they exist in South Sudan today. Workshop I was held in Sharjah, UAE, from 18 – 20 October, 2016.\nSouth Sudan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation is the political focal point for the Programme and the Ministry of Labour, Public Service, and Human Resource Development is the operational focal point.\nThe United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) is a principal training arm of the United Nations, working in every region of the world.

In collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and UN Women in Kabul, this Orientation Workshop explored the key areas of Good Governance, Social Accountability, Gender, and the SDGs. Through both lecture and practical exercises, participants were able to extend their understanding of governance and the SDGs, specifically SDG5 – Gender Equality, within the context of Afghanistan.\nThe First Lady of Afghanistan, H.E. Rula (Bibi Gul) Ghani, shared an inspiring video message at the start of the UNITAR programme. She encouraged the participants to take full advantage of the learning and networking opportunities over the next several months with UNITAR in Afghanistan and Japan, and to take the lessons learned, from the essential topics including governance and the SDGs, back to their organizations and communities to help strengthen women’s empowerment in Afghanistan.\nH.E. Mitsuji Suzuka, Ambassador of Japan to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, welcomed the launch of this epoch-making Women’s Leadership Programme for Afghan women. He stated, Japan has strongly committed to promote the dynamic engagement of women in society, therefore building a better community by empowering women leaders is an important step to strengthen Afghanistan. He believed that the participants would obtain broader experience through this programme held in Kabul, Tokyo and Hiroshima.\nMihoko Kumamoto, Director of the UNITAR Hiroshima Office, stated, “The Women’s Leadership Programme for Afghanistan gathers twenty talented young professional women to develop their knowledge on and skills of implementing good governance and gender equality in Afghanistan. Empowering all sectors of society is important for sustainable long-term development, and this programme continues the long-standing work of the UNITAR Hiroshima Office in Afghanistan.”\nWhile considering their organisations’ possible contributions to the SDGs using knowledge learned in the Orientation Workshop, the participants will now undertake an assignment to identify a pertinent issue in their organisation or community, by undertaking an Environmental Analysis and Organisational Needs Assessment, in preparation for Workshop II in Japan.\nBased on the foundation of the Orientation Workshop, as well as the results of participants’ assignments, Workshop II, which will be held in Japan in late November, will see participants will attending sessions and study tours in both Tokyo and Hiroshima.

UNITAR Master’s programmes in Conflictology, Electoral Policy and Administration, Humanitarian Action and Peacebuilding, and United Nations and the Art of Peace are tailored for professionals working within the framework of international and regional organizations, as well as governmental and non-governmental organizations.\nThe scholars chosen for the UNITAR Peace Funder campaign come from developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, African countries, and post-conflict countries. Many already work in Electoral Administration, lacking the tools and resources necessary to lead change towards transparency and clean electoral policy. Others have developed small organizations in an attempt to reduce the violent and dangerous environments present in their country of conflict but require the information and network these degrees provide. All have one thing in common: they want to make a difference that peace education can help them achieve, but unfortunately cannot afford it alone.\nThis alternative financing method mainstreams the use of crowdfunding as a bottom-up \n\nfinancing method among international organizations. UNITAR aspires to pioneer a more accessible, inclusive and community-based fundraising model, diversifying and democratizing its donor base. Crowdfunding is not merely about generating financing for their degrees – it is a vehicle for awareness raising, a platform for dialogue, a social capital enabler, a mechanism to scale up and expand impactful activities. It is an inspiring illustration of the myriad of ways in which the international community can support peacemakers and peacebuilders everywhere, in line with its long-standing commitment to reaching the furthest first and leaving no one behind.\n“Learning is an ongoing process; through this program, I will be able to implement the latest good practices in elections management and monitoring and make a positive contribution to policy-making in my home country, Zimbabwe.” -Antonetta Hamadishe, Scholar of Electoral Policy & Administration.\nIf you are interested in being a part of the campaign and helping finance accessible education for these scholars, the programme is more than happy to accept new fundraisers, coaches, and ambassadors as well.

The programme, which began with an Orientation Workshop in Kabul in mid-October, saw 20 young professional Afghan women visit Tokyo and Hiroshima, Japan, between 28 November and 8 December. The participants are young women working in Afghanistan; representing a diverse range of public sector, civil society, and private sector organizations from both Kabul and the provinces, including the Office of the First Lady, the Afghanistan Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Zan TV.\nThe 20 participants explored leadership, social accountability, and action plan development, through learning from lessons and initiatives in Japan, as well as from international experts. All the programme’s subject matter was examined through a gender lens, such as what makes effective women leaders and how each of the SDGs — not just Goal 5: Gender Equality — is impacted by gender. Based upon the Organizational Needs Assessments they had undertaken following Workshop I, during their time in Japan, participants developed robust action plans which they presented on their final day. Action plans ranged from training young women on job interviews and CV writing skills to decrease female unemployment, to providing safe-houses for children so that they are not forced to become child laborers. Many participants said they were eager to implement their action plans as soon as they return to Afghanistan.\nH.E. Dr. Bashir Mohabbat, Ambassador for the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to Japan, hosted a warm, welcoming reception for the women leaders at the Embassy in Tokyo. Towards the end of the workshop, H.E. Dr. Mohabbat joined the participants in Hiroshima and observed their final presentations, commenting: “Young people are the future of our country, but if we hope to see true peace and development in Afghanistan in the coming years, it is critical that all members of society have the tools and opportunities to participate equally. For this reason, I am glad to see the young women in the \nUNITAR Women’s Leadership Programme for Afghanistan \nengaged not only with the highly relevant subject matter the training provides but also in building bonds and communicating with each other.”\nFeaturing Resource Persons from UNITAR, UNDP, and the Gender Action Platform, the programme also included several study visits to, and guest speakers from, various organizations working on gender issues. In Tokyo, the group explored lessons learned with representatives from the Gender Equality Bureau of the Cabinet Office of the Government of Japan, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the Japan Civil Society Network on SDGs. In Hiroshima, participants visited the Hiroshima Prefectural Government Work Style Reform Promotion and Working Women Support Division, as well as Essor, the Hiroshima Women’s Centre working for gender equality. Courtesy calls were made to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, and to the Governor of Hiroshima Prefecture. Participants also visited the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, and met with Ms. Keiko Ogura, a \nhibakusha\n(Atomic Bomb survivor), exploring one model of post-conflict reconstruction and the powerful message of peace that Hiroshima shares with the world.\nMs. Mihoko Kumamoto, Director of the UNITAR Hiroshima Office, stated, “Looking toward 2030, Afghanistan is taking concrete steps toward achieving the SDGs, but we cannot simply assume these goals will be achieved without the active participation of women in all fields. The group of twenty passionate and talented women leaders is now equipped with the knowledge, skills, and network to lead the way toward sustainable development, peace, and the empowerment of all in Afghanistan”\nThe programme also taught concrete skills related to project development and implementation. Ms. Tahera Fahimi, a Program Officer at the Organization for Better Tomorrow in Afghanistan, said, “This workshop showed me the logical relationships between the steps to identify needs, looking for solutions, and developing projects to address these needs, as well as how our organizations can help society.”\nIn the programme’s closing ceremony, a participant called on everyone to share their key message. With one voice, the 20 women said, “We will bring the change.”\nPhoto 1: Group photo taken at the Embassy of Afghanistan in Japan\nPhoto 2: Participants visiting the Atomic-bomb Dome in Hiroshima. \n"},

The Fellowship is a six-month specialized capacity-building programme examining entrepreneurship and youth leadership in the context of Iraq and incorporating two face-to-face international workshops, blending online and asynchronous learning, and participant-led real-world projects. The Fellowship is implemented with the generous support of the Government of Japan. \nTwenty-four Fellows, including eight women, from various public sector, private sector, academic institutions, and civil society organizations participated in the training. The Fellows, young leaders in Iraqi society, gained project development and high-level entrepreneurship skills in Workshop II. All learning was augmented by individual and group practical exercises, as well as frequent opportunities for Fellows to present their work, evidencing knowledge transfer and encouraging ownership of the learning process.\nAfter paying a courtesy call to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo, Fellows began the workshop in Hiroshima by presenting the results of a Needs Assessment of their organization, undertaken in Baghdad and utilizing the learning undertaken at Workshop I (conducted in late 2016). The needs Fellows identified through this process included, amongst others: medical care for Internally Displaced Persons; connecting local artisans to business opportunities through an online marketplace; and revising entrepreneurship curriculum for post-conflict areas. All needs assessments were focused on the common goal of improving the livelihood of Iraqis and making the country more self-sufficient and stable in the future. At the end of the workshop, Fellows presented their projects again, this time including the project design and development tools they developed during the workshop.\nHigh-level entrepreneurship was another focus of Workshop II, with Fellows working in teams to develop business models for four of their peers’ entrepreneurial organizations. The final day of the workshop also included an examination of leadership and work styles and how these can contribute to the design and development of effective teams. The workshop concluded with a graduation ceremony and a celebration of Iraqi culture. \nOne of the Fellows who participated in Workshop II, Ali Nahi Abed Al-Hasnawi, said, \"This is my first time taking an entrepreneurship skills course; it will help me to implement my project, which will be useful for the Iraqi Ministry of Oil. If we implement my work, we can develop our staff, buy more equipment, and depend on ourselves.\" He also commented on the story of Hiroshima's reconstruction: \"I saw the massive size of the destruction and the effect of the bomb on Hiroshima, but the people of Hiroshima worked together to rebuild their city and develop Hiroshima again. We face a similar situation in Iraq, but we will work hard to rebuild our country.\"\nAnother Fellow, Sama Basil Kamal Al-Juboori, said, \"One of the main lessons from Hiroshima's reconstruction is to forgive and not forget; it had a great effect on me.” She continued, “I have not been in a programme with government, private sector, and NGOs at the same place, and this programme has created an atmosphere for people from diverse professional backgrounds to work together and try to understand each other better. When we go back to Iraq, we will utilize this training to start working together.”\nUNITAR Hiroshima Office Head Mihoko Kumamoto commented, “The Fellows, who were selected through a competitive screening process, came from diverse backgrounds. They were energetic, dynamic, and committed to learning from experiences in Hiroshima and around the world. Inclusive development, which incorporates voices from all segments of society, including youth, is key to the peaceful and sustainable development of Iraq. We are honored to assist Iraq to achieve such development through this training programme.”\nThe United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) is a principal training arm of the United Nations, working in every region of the world. We empower individuals, governments and organizations through knowledge and learning to effectively overcome contemporary global challenges. The UNITAR Hiroshima Office, mandated to promote post-conflict reconstruction and international peace, has long engaged in designing and conducting training for people from post-conflict countries, such as Afghanistan and South Sudan, and commands a unique understanding of the needs of such trainees as they work toward peace. \nAt UNITAR Hiroshima\n\nShamsul Hadi SHAMS (Mr.)\n\nE-mail: \nshamsul.shams@unitar.org\n\nPhone: +81 82 511 2424\n"},

Surgical care is the foundation of the treatment options for most of these diseases.\nThe urgency to move forward\n was clearly seen at the 72nd World Health Assembly recently.

Its mission is to facilitate the development of surgical, obstetrical and anaesthesia care systems that will ensure universal access to emergency and essential surgical care.  GSF will create a common, collaborative platform aimed at building capacity across the wide spectrum of surgical care systems, including obstetrics, paediatrics, injury and trauma, and the treatment of NCDs such as cancer. The platform will facilitate a coordinated, integrated effort to meet the unmet surgical needs, including service delivery, training and funding. This will be underpinned by world class research and knowledge sharing to examine sustainable solutions to meet this global need for surgical care, including innovative funding mechanisms to assist nations in building their surgical capacity in a self-reliant manner. \nThe exciting feature of this new initiative is that the start-up funding has come from Africa.  The founding donor, the Rali and Makentse Mampeule Foundation of South Africa, is eager to make a difference for their community in Africa, and in particular, by addressing the unmet needs of surgical care globally.\nThe GSF Secretariat is hosted by UNITAR and initial activities have already started, including the development of a mobile application on the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist, preparations for National Surgical Planning and Policy Workshops in Nepal and Egypt, the dissemination of multiple surgical team training modules, and a national surgical plan implementation pilot project in Zambia.  \nFor more information, please visit \nwww.globalsurgeryfoundation.org\n or contact Ms. Rabab Fayad, Senior Adviser, Global Surgery Foundation, \nglobalsurgery@unitar.org\n.\n"},

The programme is a six-month capacity-building training for junior- to mid-career-level professionals that focuses on project management, leadership, and social entrepreneurship skills. This year, 25 Fellows and Coaches, including 11 women, from the public sector, private sector, academic institutions, media, and civil society organisations of South Sudan will take part in the programme. \nNow in its third cycle, the programme has 50 alumni, who represent 34 different organizations. Coaches, standout Fellows from the previous cycle who provide mentorship to current Fellows throughout the programme, are again a part of the group. The Coaches will not only share their own experiences but also provide Fellows with lessons learned and insight gained through communication with their counterparts from various sectors. \nThe Orientation Workshop, which marked the first time the diverse group has come together, provided the new Fellows with an overview of the programme and helped them prepare for the coming workshops and assignments. The first session covered expectations and roles and responsibilities for both Fellows and UNITAR, as well as the programme structure and timeline. In the second session, Fellows undertook individual needs assessment with UNITAR to identify their specific learning needs, so that UNITAR can further tailor the learning objectives of the programme to address them in an effective manner. Finally, Fellows received an introduction to Japanese culture, in order to prepare them for the workshop in Hiroshima later this fall. \nWorkshop I, schedules to take place from 16 to 20 August in Entebbe, Uganda, will introduce Fellows to social entrepreneurship and will go into detail regard types of Organizational Needs Assessment and best practices.  \nUNITAR Hiroshima Office Head Mihoko Kumamoto remarked, “We are excited to announce the successful kick-start of the UNITAR South Sudan Fellowship Programme Cycle 2017. This programme aims at building a cohort of future leaders who are committed to serving the people of South Sudan and creating a better future for the country. In addition, their fall visit to Hiroshima, which has revived from ashes to a beautiful, modern, resilient city, will give them opportunities to learn important lessons on peace and post-conflict recovery. We would like to express our sincere appreciation to our partners, particularly the people of South Sudan, the people of Japan, UNDP, and UN Women for joining hands with us to support the future of South Sudan.”\nH.E. Kiya Masahiko, Ambassador of Japan to South Sudan, first requested the participants of the ceremony to join him in praying for the victims of 1945 August 6th Nuclear Weapon attack to Hiroshima, and all those who became victims of war and conflict all over the world. He then expressed: \"I am very glad to see the successful start of UNITAR Leadership and Entrepreneurship Programme today. I hope that, through this programme, the selected Fellows will learn not only technical skills related to leadership and social entrepreneurship but also will be inspired by witnessing with their own eyes how people in Hiroshima have achieved post-war recovery and reconstruction to date. The Government and the people of Japan will continue supporting capacity building of highly-motivated South Sudanese people through various projects, including UNITAR fellowship. \"\nMr. Garang Akuel Athiang, Acting Director of Human Resource Development, Ministry of Labor, Public Service, and Human Resource Development, Republic of South Sudan, said during the workshop, “The impact of this programme is important to the Ministry of Labor, because it’s our responsibility to help train South Sudanese to have a better future. I would like to give a special thanks to UNITAR for the programme that has taken up such service. The subjects of this training, leadership and entrepreneurship, are very important to South Sudan.” Mr. Athiang also commended the role of Coaches, who were selected based on their work as Fellows during the previous programme cycle. He advised current Fellows to make the best use of Coaches’ knowledge during the programme and to work hard so that they too can become mentors to their fellow South Sudanese. \nMr. Isaac Chinkok Kenti, Director General of the Institute for Democratic Studies, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Republic of South Sudan, who also attended the workshop, told Fellows to “get expertise in the relevant areas that are important to South Sudan.” He reminded the gathering that South Sudan is lucky because it has many young and energetic people who can play role in the reconstruction of the country. Mr. Kenti also said he was happy to see the assembled Fellows because they “were all selected on a competitive basis – no tribalism, no nepotism.” Mr. Kenti continued, “I am confident that you are competent enough to understand and utilize what you are being taught.”\nOne of the Fellows, Mary Kadi E. Manoah, said, “We aspire to emulate the example of Hiroshima, which, through its visionary aspects, was able to reconstruct itself into what it is today. This training will surely help us focus our energies together to achieve more overall. We look forward to the continuity of such programmes to contribute to building our own capacities, as well as those of our beneficiaries, represented by the various institutions in our country. Our sincerest gratitude goes to the whole UNITAR team and the Japanese and South Sudanese Governments for this invaluable opportunity.”\nThe UNITAR South Sudan Fellowship Programme was developed by the UNITAR Hiroshima Office, with funding support from the Government and people of Japan and with institutional support from the Government of the Republic of South Sudan, to cultivate the social entrepreneurship and project-development knowledge, skills, and attitudes of selected South Sudanese professionals. The programme features a blended learning methodology and includes asynchronous and online training, coupled with two juba-based and two international workshops. Each workshop links with Fellows-led projects examining challenges and opportunities as they exist in South Sudan today. \nSocial entrepreneurship is the main theme of this year’s programme. The majority of the South Sudan’s population is youth; providing them with the entrepreneurial skills and insight to identify business opportunities, to lead, and to develop projects that will address the needs of their communities and create employment opportunities is critical to the country’s future. \nSouth Sudan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation is the political focal point for the programme and the Ministry of Labour, Public Service, and Human Resource Development is the operational focal point.\nThe United Nations Institute for Training and Research is a principal training arm of the United Nations, working in every region of the world.

The achievement of diplomatic, communication and negotiation skills is necessary for honorary consuls to fulfill the expectations states have for them, such as the repatriation efforts, attraction of foreign investments and international outreach.

E.\nAmina Mohammed\n, \"[t]he only investment that we can make to improve the work of this institions is to invest in building the capacity of honorary consuls\".\nThe second session of the forum highlighted the best practices of honorary consuls in the current crisis and the future expectations. \"In this COVID era, we are seeing even a greater value in having Honorary Consuls in our constellation of diplomats\" – stated \nH. E. Chet Greene\n. In the same vein,\n H. E. Gaston Browne\n, the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda pointed out significant contributions of honorary consuls during the current crisis in “[…] mobilizing medical equipment, PPEs, medical supplies, medicines and ventilators”. While key challenges in the increase reliance on honorary consuls have been identified too, there is a clear consensus recognizing the importance of honorary consuls and acknowledging the necessity to elevate their position as it appears in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 1963. \"We must engage in as much countries as possible and the question that comes to us is how do we maximize the use of our very limited resources\" – expressed\nH. E. Peter David\n, Foreign Minister of Grenada. This first successful phase of UNITAR’s Training Programmes on International Diplomatic Law for Honorary Consuls has provided the opportunity to bring together different stakeholders who shared their respective experiences.\nUNITAR is proud to address the needs for training in launching two training programmes focusing on international diplomatic law for honorary consuls on 20 July 2020, which will constitute the starting point of a progressive change in the perception and utilization of honorary consuls in the future. Both programmes\n include insights into the obligations, privileges, and immunities of honorary consuls under international law, as well as several practical skills necessary to effectively fulfil their duties. UNITAR's International Law Team, run by Ms.\n Anna Sabrina Wollmann\n, has developed these programmes in cooperation with Professor \nJ. Craig Barker\n (Dean of the School of Law and Social Sciences at London South Bank University) and \nMr\n. \nRichard H.

Both organizations, represented by Mr. Nikhil Seth, United Nations Assistant Secretary-General and Executive Director of UNITAR, and by Mr. Nasser B. Al-Kahtani, Executive Director of the AGFUND, will sign a Memorandum of Understanding based on mutual trust and in spirit of cooperation. The official signing will be the preamble of the “Symposium on the Role of Financial Inclusion in Achieving the 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development”, organized by the AGFUND and taking place today at the Hotel President Wilson in Geneva.\nThe objectives of this Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) are to provide a cooperative framework within which the parties can develop and implement activities, as well as to utilize their existing resources for the benefit of the activities’ beneficiaries. The forms of cooperation between the two organizations will include the development of technical assistance, training, conferences, workshops, and the development of knowledge resources such as reports and research papers. The UNITAR and AGFUND’s major concern? Financial inclusion, mainly in the African region. This area of work – that can be defined by financial services (e.g. credit, savings, payments, mortgage) delivered at affordable costs to disadvantaged populations as a tool for poverty reduction – falls within the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Financial inclusion is important to allow the beneficiaries to save money or take loans in order to study, to start new businesses, invest in small companies, and increase the standard of living, etc.\nAccording to Mr. Nikhil Seth, “While the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) do not explicitly mention financial inclusion, greater access to financial services is a key enabler for many of them”, as he introduced his speech this morning. UNITAR’s Executive Director believes that national financial inclusion strategies provide the groundwork for coordinated efforts between government, private sector and civil society. The SDGs call for action by all countries and the SDG areas cannot be financed from public resources alone and will require private financing, hence the partnership with the AGFUND and other partnerships, such as the collaboration with Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA).  \nThe Fifth AGFUND Development Forum takes place in Geneva, during the period 18-20 April 2017 at the Hotel President Wilson. The Forum will be held under the patronage of HRH Prince Talal Bin Abdul Aziz, President of AGFUND, and attended by development partners, media and AGFUND Prize winners. \nThe United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) is a principal training arm of the United Nations, working in every region of the world. We empower individuals, governments and organizations through knowledge and learning to effectively overcome contemporary global challenges. The UNITAR Hiroshima Office, mandated to promote post-conflict reconstruction and international peace, has long engaged in designing and conducting training for people from post-conflict countries, such as Afghanistan and South Sudan, and commands a unique understanding of the needs of such trainees as they work toward peace. \n"},

This makes e-waste the world’s fastest-growing domestic waste stream, fueled mainly by higher consumption rates of electric and electronic equipment, short life cycles, and few options for repair.\nOnly 17.4 per cent of 2019’s e-waste was collected and recycled. This means that gold, silver, copper, platinum and other high-value, recoverable materials conservatively valued at US $57 billion -- a sum greater than the Gross Domestic Product of most countries – were mostly dumped or burned rather than being collected for treatment and reuse. \nAccording to the report, Asia generated the greatest volume of e-waste in 2019 — some 24.9 Mt, followed by the Americas (13.1 Mt) and Europe (12 Mt), while Africa and Oceania generated 2.9 Mt and 0.7 Mt respectively. \nFor perspective, last year’s e-waste weighed substantially more than all the adults in Europe, or as much as 350 cruise ships the size of the Queen Mary 2, enough to form a line 125 km long.   \nE-waste is a health and environmental hazard, containing toxic additives or hazardous substances such as mercury, which damages the human brain and / or coordination system.\nThe Global E-waste Monitor 2020 (\nwww.globalewaste.org\n) is a collaborative product of the Global E-waste Statistics Partnership (GESP), formed by UN University (UNU), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the International Solid Waste Association (ISWA), in close collaboration with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). The World Health Organization (WHO) and the German Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) also substantially contributed to this year’s Global E-waste Monitor 2020.\n“The findings of this year's UNU-affiliated Global E-waste Monitor suggest that humanity is not sufficiently implementing the SDGs. Substantially greater efforts are urgently required to ensure smarter and more sustainable global production, consumption, and disposal of electrical and electronic equipment.  This report contributes mightily to the sense of urgency in turning around this dangerous global pattern.”\n - \nDavid M. Malone\n, Rector United Nations University (UNU) & UN Under Secretary General\n“Far more electronic waste is generated than is being safely recycled in most parts of the world. More cooperative efforts are required to make aware of this increasing issue and take appropriate countermeasures supplement by appropriate research and training. I am pleased that UNITAR now joins this important Global E-waste Statistics Partnership of UNU, ITU and ISWA, illustrating how valuable these activities are.” - \nNikhil Seth, \nExecutive Director, United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) & UN Assistant Secretary-General\n‘’The Global E-waste Monitor highlights the pressing issue of e-waste management in today’s digitally connected world in that the way we produce, consume, and dispose of electronic devices has become unsustainable. Monitoring e-waste streams will contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and tracking the implementation of the ITU Connect 2030 Agenda. The Monitor serves as a valuable resource for governments to improve their global e-waste recycling rate by developing the necessary/needed/required e-waste policies and legislation. ITU will continue to support the efforts made in this report towards the global response required in identifying solutions for e-waste.” - \nDoreen Bogdan-Martin\n, Director, Telecommunication Development Bureau, International Telecommunication Union (ITU)\n“E-waste quantities are rising 3 times faster than the world’s population and 13 per cent faster than the world’s GDP during the last five years. This sharp rise creates substantial environmental and health pressures and demonstrates the urgency to combine the fourth industrial revolution with circular economy. The fourth industrial revolution either will advance a new circular economy approach for our economies or it will stimulate further resource depletion and new pollution waves.  The progress achieved in e-waste monitoring by the Global E-waste Statistics Partnership is a sign of hope that the world can manage not only to monitor closely the e-waste rise but also to control their impacts and set up proper management schemes” - \nAntonis Mavropoulos\n, President, International Solid Waste Association (ISWA)\n“Informal and improper e-waste recycling is a major emerging hazard silently affecting our health and that of future generations. One in four children are dying from avoidable environmental exposures. One in four children could be saved, if we take action to protect their health and ensure a safe environment. WHO is pleased to join forces in this new Global E-waste Monitor to allow evidence, information about health impacts and joint solutions and policies to be made available to protect our future generations’ health.” - \nMaria Neira\n, \nDirector, Environment, Climate Change and Health Department, World Health Organization (WHO)\nJoin the conversation on social media using hashtag \n#eWaste\nThe GESP helps countries compile useful national policy-making statistics using an internationally-recognized harmonized measurement framework. The GESP convenes policy makers, statisticians, and industry representatives to enhance the quality, and their understanding and interpretation of e-waste data.  At the global level, the GESP contributes to the monitoring of relevant waste streams, measuring progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals 11.6, 12.4 and 12.5. The GESP allows international organizations, such as the ITU, to measure progress towards their goals. In 2018, the ITU established a target to increase the global e-waste recycling rate to 30 per cent by 2023 — a 12.6 per cent increase from today’s global average.\nThe International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the specialized United Nations agency for information and communication technologies (ICTs), driving innovation in ICTs together with 193 Member States and a membership of over 900 companies, universities, and international and regional organizations. Established over 150 years ago in 1865, ITU is the intergovernmental body responsible for coordinating the shared global use of the radio spectrum, promoting international cooperation in assigning satellite orbits, improving communication infrastructure in the developing world, and establishing the worldwide standards that foster seamless interconnection of a vast range of communications systems.
