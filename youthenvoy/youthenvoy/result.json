I cannot stress enough the need for a collective responsibility to deliver on the commitments we are making within these rooms, so all young people can live a life of dignity and freedom.\nBy Sunday, June 22, the new Lisboa+21 Declaration was adopted. The Declaration was built based on the rights-based approach and youth-centered policies emphasized active youth participation and engagement and are aligned with the #Youth2030 agenda.\nI was proud to see that governments from all over the world gathered in Lisbon to celebrate this milestone, and as well as to commit to the #Lisboa21 Declaration.

The world is in desperate need for leadership in DRR and climate action, and at #GP2019Geneva I urged everyone not to leave the event without ambition: “Young people are calling world leaders to take action, let us not let their call become a missed call.”\nI had the chance to meet with strong supporters of young people such as Secretary-General Elhadj As Sy of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. We discussed the challenges youth volunteers face on the ground.

These inspiring young women leaders are elected by their peers as student parliamentarians to represent their voices but also to lead on community projects. Not only did they share their story and showed me their classrooms, but they also pointed out the challenges that affect their education.\nLack of continuity of teachers, maintenance of school buildings, and recreational spaces are only some of the few things that these young people have to face. Without adequate funding, it will be difficult to ensure that these young women have a chance to continue their education.\nI also joined the UNRWA Summer Camp in Ramallah when I visited the West Bank. Here, young men & women from the age of 18-24 years old can develop their leadership skills and connect with other young Palestine Refugees.\nDuring this mission, I also had the opportunity to visit Gaza.

UNRWA’s schools in Gaza operate on a 2-shift basis, hosting one group of students in the morning & a different group in the afternoon.

Sadly, they fear missing out on education due to funding cuts to UNRWA.\nI also met UNRWA Student Parliamentarians during my visit to the Gaza Strip. Not only that they told me about their dreams of becoming doctors, engineers, diplomats, and teachers, they also shared with me the challenges they constantly have to face. They told me about how electricity cuts are affecting their studies, how difficult it is to travel outside of Gaza for studies. They also shared about the increasing mental health issues among their peers and rising domestic violence. Regardless of the dire circumstances, they continue to dream, and they don’t give up.\nThen I got the opportunity to meet the beneficiaries of Vocational Training and Microfinance Programs. The quality and outcomes of these programs were exceptional. Today, the youth Unemployment In the Gaza Strip is ~68% and with more support, UNRWA can scale up these initiatives and reach more unemployed young people.\nFinally, I met with Gaza Sky Geeks, (the world’s toughest coders!). What we always see on the news about Gaza is conflict, violence, and destruction; but young people are resilient. The Gaza Sky Geeks an example as to how young people use technology to create and innovate even in the midst of dire humanitarian conditions.\nEvery young person deserves lives of dignity. Gaza’s problems need long term solutions, but the International Community has a collective responsibility towards these young people.

The mission was graciously supported by the Inter Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) and the United Nations Populations Fund (UNFPA). Below you can read about the highlights. \n\nThe UN Secretary General’s Envoy on Youth, Ms. Wickramanayake, arrived in Dhaka upon an invitation from the Ministry of Youth and Sports in Bangladesh to observe International Youth Day on 6 August 2018. Each year, International Youth Day is a celebration of the role of young people as essential partners in promoting human rights and development – at the same time, it is an opportunity to raise awareness about the challenges and marginalization that many young people face around the world. \nThe 2018 theme for International Youth Day was “Safe Spaces for Youth,” which highlights the imperative need to ensure that young people have access to safe public, civic, physical, and digital spaces. As the Youth Envoy said in her official remarks, “\n.” Ms. Wickramanayake added that, “\n.” \nMinistry of Youth and Sports / Gazy Golam\nWhile in Dhaka, Ms. Wickramanayake met with young cadets at the Foreign Service Academy, a group of young parliamentarians in the National Parliament, high-level officials and Honorable Ministers. The Youth Envoy used these engagements to raise awareness on the importance of youth participation in civic and political affairs, emphasizing that investment in youth is the path to building a more sustainable and peaceful future. During her stay she also conducted a series of meetings with the Ministry of youth Affairs and Sports, UN Resident Coordinator, Ms. Mia Seppo, the UN country team, the UN Youth Advisory Panel, Youth Organizations and the donor community. \nFurther, the Youth Envoy conducted a UNFPA-organized visit to Sher-e-Bangla Nagar Girls Public School in a local neighborhood, where she was warmly welcomed by the school leadership and pupils. The Envoy’s day engaged in discussions about the limitations of gender-stereotypes and challenges of being a girl in a highly patriarchal society, including themes such as sexuality and reproductive health, sexual violence, child marriage. She also played educational board games that embody women’s empowerment. \n” said the Envoy addressing those in attendance, “\n”\nUNFPA / Meher Jerin\nIn addition, Ms. Wickaramanayake had the opportunity to spend an afternoon in one of the adolescent clubs that serves as a Safe Space for young adults aged 11-19 living in low income neighborhood. For many young people the adolescent clubs were one of the few opportunities to socialize in structured activities outside the home, and also serves as a mechanism for early identification of young people at risk and referral to services. The visit was organized by UNICEF in partnership with BRAC.\nUNICEF / Karen\n\nThis 25 August serves as the one-year mark of the outbreak of the Rohingya refugee crisis, which took the Youth Envoy to the Cox’s Bazar region of Bangladesh, where nearly a million refugees reside. She used the visit to highlight the need for safe spaces for youth – in particular, young refugees who lack access to basic human rights including clean water, sanitation, and education.\nISCG / Rui Padilha\nAmong her many engagements, the Ms. Wickramanayake visited the Kutupalong Camp: the largest and most densely populated refugee camp on our planet. The Youth Envoy met with a group of young refugees, men and women, who works as Community Outreach Volunteers supported by UNNHCR. Despite the challenges they themselves face, they were eager to make positive contributions to their community and volunteered to solve local issues in the camp, such as shelter repairs, tree planting etc. This was followed by a UNFPA organized meeting with a group of refugees who receive life planning skills training as part of the project, implemented by local NGOs. During this event, the Youth Envoy instigated a drawing competition in which they drew their favorite safe space, followed by a heartwarming ceremony where she presented awards to the art winners. \nISCG / Rui Padilha\nSupported by UNICEF, the Envoy on Youth visited an all-girls adolescents club and, which gathered young women from the camp as well as the host community. Being young and female is one of the biggest risk factors for violence during humanitarian crisis, which is why such spaces are vital. In the club, she watched a role play about child marriage and engaged in a candid discussion about the gender-specific challenges these young women experience in their day to day lives. Last, but not least, Ms. Wickramanayake made a stop at Masters Skills training center facilitated by BRAC, to meet with young people from the host community and discuss the challenges of living in one of the most under-developed regions of the country, with low rate of education attainment and high unemployment. \nISCG / Rui Padilha\nDespite the challenging scale of the Rohingya refugee crisis, Ms. Wickramanayake expressed her astoundment with the resilience of the young people she met during her visit to Cox’s Bazar, and the strength they possess in striving to rebuild their society and solve community issues, even within a context of displacement. \nDuring her visit, the Youth Envoy met with the Senior Coordinator of the Rohingya refugee response, Heads of UN Sub-Offices and members of the \n, to discuss how humanitarian partners can better address the unique priorities, needs and rights of young people – especially the need for education and skills building training.  \nShe furthermore met with a group of committed young humanitarian workers who are active in the refugee response. Too often, young people are an overlooked resource in humanitarian assistance, which was also a message the Youth Envoy highlighted on the subsequent \n. \nFor more impressions from the mission to Cox’s Bazar, watch the \n from the visit hosted by UNHCR.\n—\nAll in all, the main themes emerging from the mission to Bangladesh included: safe spaces for youth, including road safety; sexual and reproductive health and rights with a specific focus on child marriage; the need for a youth-focused refugee response; and as always, promoting young people’s involvement at every stage of policy making and leadership. \n"},

It’s been filled with challenges, but also with opportunities and support from those who believe in the power of young people – both within and outside the UN.\nIn July 2017, I became the youngest member of the United Nations Senior Management Team. And one of the most memorable moments I lived in my life, was when I first met the Secretary-General as his Envoy on Youth. In that meeting, the Secretary-General asked me to misbehave, to be the trigger of change in the United Nations System and beyond. I want to thank the Secretary-General, António Guterres, for placing his trust in me and in my small but powerful office for leading this ambitious task.\nThis particular moment, inspired the greatest achievement of 2018. Launching Youth 2030, the first-ever United Nations Youth Strategy, brought to me unmeasurable emotion. The challenges of bringing together vastly different interests under a common roof are immense, but the importance and relevance young people should have in today’s world are even greater!\nToday we are facing a critical time in history, with the world seeing the largest generation of young people ever – 1.8 billion. Most them live in developing countries where they tend to make up a large proportion of the population. In the least developed countries, the numbers will only continue to grow. Don’t get me wrong, this is not a problem. It’s rather a solution to the majority of the issues we face globally. Young people are change-makers, innovators and leaders. They have broken barriers, changed systems, brought peace, fought against climate change, and saved lives. Too often, they do this with little or no resources and no access to decision-making tables. Imagine what they could do, if they were fully empowered and given a seat at the table!\nRead our Impact Report \n.\nPlease take this report, not as a celebration of what my office and I have done for young people, but as yet another small step to support young people in realizing their full potential and go even beyond.\nWe still have a lot to do!\nIn hope and gratitude,\nYouthfully,\n \n"},

Over 1000 young people from all over the world gathered together and shared their valuable insights with Governments, Civil Society Organisations and Youth Networks. The ECOSOC Youth Forum is the largest annual youth gathering at the United Nations. It serves as an important channel for both young people and Government officials to exchange updates on global youth engagement, to initiate discussions on global issues, and to reiterate the full-level collaborations to implement the 2030 Agenda and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThis year’s Forum was held under the theme of “Empowered, Included, and Equal”. This theme highlights the importance of including young people’s engagement in the scope of global discussions. It also aims to promote international collaboration between Member States and Civil Society to be supported in empowering young stakeholders’ active engagement.\nYoung people’s force is an opportunity we cannot miss. Representing over 1.8 billion young people all over the world, participants of the ECOSOC Youth Forum continued to strive for their participation at the decision-making table, and fearlessly came up with meaningful recommendations on the process of realizing the SDGs. This year’s forum firstly focused on reviewing the following six SDGs: SDG4 (Quality Education), SDG8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG13 (Climate Action), SDG16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), and SDG17 (Partnerships for the Goals).\nHere are some exciting moments from the 2019 ECOSOC Youth Forum, starting by the Envoy on Youth kicking-off the Forum with the President of ECOSOC, Ambassador Inga Rhonda King, and the President of General Assembly, Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa, following by thematic discussion on the implementations of SDGs, regional discussions on key concerns and priorities for youth by regions, interactive dialogues between young representatives and government officials to identify young people’s role in the SDG implementation process, etc.\n\nTo conclude this year’s Forum in one sentence: “young people must have a seat at the table”. The record-breaking number of youth participants joined different plenary sessions in the two-day forum, and shared their valuable inputs from how to actively step-up climate action, to how to ensure a better future of employment. In the opening, the United Nations Envoy on Youth, Ms. Jayathma Wickramanayake welcomed all participants with Ambassador Inga Rhonda King, President of ECOSOC, and Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa, President of General Assembly with a meaningful dialogue.\nIn the dialogue, Ms. Wickramanayake stressed that, “There is no limit to what this generation – the largest, most educated, most globally-minded in history – can deliver.” She also mentioned the importance of prioritizing young people’s needs ahead of the SDG and Climate Action Summits later this year, in September. To achieve such goals, it is pointed out that continuous appreciation and trust in multilateralism and dialogue – especially among young people and Governments – are needed to achieve a fairer globalization for all. Amb. King also shared her insights in the dialogue by pointing out that “Young people’s contribution to peace and security is increasingly recognized as essential to realizing the 2030 Agenda.” It is utterly important to fully include young people in political and economic life. She also shared her worries of how young people are still victims of violence and conflicts in many regions, but their positive influence should not be neglected in the process of preventing and solving such conflicts. In agreement, Ms. Espinosa, said her goal is to ensure youth, peace and security is at the center of her work and noted that the first International Symposium on Youth Participation in Peace Processes in Helsinki has strengthened the argument that young people have advanced peace processes.\n\nThis Year’s Forum consisted of various regional and thematic sessions in which young participants and Member States shared updates on the implementation of the SDGs in different regions, initiated the future plans of realizing the 2030 Agenda, and offered insights on tackling pressing issues from quality education to climate change.\n\nDuring the sessions, young people from different regions raised key regional concerns for youth relating to the SDGs implementation. For example, Mr. Yi Yangqianxi – World Health Organization China Special Envoy for Health – briefed the Asia-Pacific Regions Session and pointed out that gender equality, education, and empowerment as three top needs for young people. In another session, Ms. Farai Mubaiwa – Member of The Aurum Institute and Africa Matters Initiative pointed out that the urgency of solving youth unemployment issue in South Africa, and shared her opinion on how economic exclusion can lead to both mental and physical violence, which were key threats to young people in her region.\nAs young participants from all over the world shared their concerns during the sessions, they also proposed meaningful recommendations on how to solve these issues and support the 2030 Agenda. Ms. Sophia Fei Ya Chen, the thematic focal point, updated on the breakout session on SDG8 and proposed that “States must involve young people in creatively incentivizing partnerships among Governments, the Private Sector, Academia and other stakeholders,” and putting young people at the core of development efforts is crucial to solve most of the economic issues we face today. In another session, Gogontlejang Phaladi stressed that young people must be supported in political leadership roles, so that their needs can be fulfilled.\nRepresentatives from UN agencies and Member States also provided valuable insights during the review of the SDGs. All of them continued to reiterate their support engaging youth globally, and urged young people to be the change our society needs to push world leaders to carry their responsibilities and ensure all of us can have a brighter, sustainable future.\n\n2019 is a year full of opportunities for young people to participate in global discussions, and for Heads of States and Governments, and Member States to recognize young people’s contributions and realize their recommendations. As the curtain went down for the ECOSOC Youth Forum, it is more of a start rather than an end. The forthcoming events such as the United Nations General Assembly, the Climate Summit and the SDG Summit in September will examine the progress of the 2030 Agenda, and draw new plans based on such evaluation. Carrying the torch of #Youth2030: the UN Youth Strategy launched last September, the ECOSOC Youth Forum has paved of the way for young people’s active participation in all the imminent global discussions.\nIn the closing ceremony of the ECOSOC Youth Forum, Ambassador King reaffirmed the need to include young people in all levels of policy-making processes, and expressed the wish to see this need translated into action, starting at the annual political forum in July. All participants of ECOSOC Youth Forum are expected to take the Forum’s outcomes and their experience to their communities – further boosting the work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\n"},

It provides a space for intergenerational and intersectional conversations, best practice exchange and networking for young gender advocates from all over the world.\nTo ensure the amplification of these voices, the UN Secretary-General’s Envoy on Youth, Jayathma Wickramanayake, engaged in the activities of the CSW63 Youth Dialogue.\nHere you will find some of the key highlights.\nOn Saturday 9 March, Jayathma gave the introductory remarks and participated as the moderator in the opening panel of the Pre-CSW Youth Dialogue; an open space for youth activists to voice their opinions and discuss strategies to influence the CSWdiscussions.\nThe opening panel of the Pre-CSW Youth Dialogue saw the participation of Deputy Secretary-General, Ms. Amina Mohammed; Dr. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women; Mr. Dereje Wordofa, Deputy Executive Director of Programme of UNFPA; Mr. Vinicius Pinheiro, Special Representative to the United Nations and Director of ILO-New York; Ms. Lucia Ruvarashe Ndanga, young activist from WAGGGs Zimbabwe; Ms. Gharsanay Ibnul Amen, Young Activist from Afghanistan; and Rad Pereira, young Brazilian artivist.\nThrough a workshop modality, the participants validated a set of common minimum standards (available \n) that will act as guidelines to policy makers to ensure that social protection systems, public services and sustainable infrastructure address their particular needs. This set of common minimum standards was presented to policy makers to facilitate the legitimate inclusion of young people, within the broader CSW63 discussions and negotiations.\nGirls Scouts and the Working Group on Girls, World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, International Association of Students in Economics and Management, World Young Men’s Christian Association, Association for Women’s Rights in Development, WE, Restless Development, MenEngage Alliance, CHOICE for Youth, ACT Alliance, Rozaria Memorial Trust, FRIDA, Soul City Institute of Social Justice, Plan International, African Women Leadership Network, Afrika Youth Movement, Mexico Women with Disability Movement, the Young Feminist Caucus and the youth delegates, were some of the youth-led and youth-serving organizations that engaged actively in the organization of this event.\nOn Monday 11 March, Jayathma met with the Youth Delegates attending the CSW. The UN Youth Delegate Programme is a modality that paves the way for youth participation in decision making through the inclusion of youth delegates in a country’s official delegation.  \nDuring the meeting the delegates and the Youth Envoy – a former youth delegate herself – discussed strategies to influence delegations and contribute with qualified inputs from the Common Minimum Standards towards the CSW63 agreed conclusions.\nOn Tuesday 12 March, the Envoy on Youth served as the moderator at the high-level luncheon on Women in Power, which was hosted by the President of the General Assembly and the Permanent Mission of the State of Qatar.\nIn this meeting, a panel of young women leaders came together to talk about how to achieve women’s equal participation and leadership in all spheres of life, while re-assuring its importance to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. The room was filled with Ministers, senior leaders from governments, the UN system and youth activist and entrepreneurs who were all eager to engage, which contributed to a dynamic and lively discussion.\nSome of the topics discussed by the panelists included challenges that women face in the workplace – such as maternity leave, – and how world leaders can ensure that typically less “female friendly” industries like technology and innovation can support gender equality. For instance, investing in teacher training, increasing access to technology, mentorships, and recognizing young female community leaders are concrete measure to ensure more women in leadership positions in the future.\nThe event counted with the participation of Victoria Alonsoperez, an Electronics, Telecommunication, and Electrical Engineer, Entrepreneur, Inventor, and United Nations Young Leader for the Sustainable Development Goals; Emma Camp, a multi-awarded Researcher Fellow at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), National Geographic Explorer and United Nations Young Leader for the Sustainable Development Goals; Jennifer Uchendu, a sustainability communicator, analyst, and founder of SustyVibes, a social enterprise making sustainability actionable for young people through projects, products and policies; and Linda Liukas, Forbes’ top-50 most powerful women in tech Europe, author and illustrator of Hello Ruby, a picture book series on code, computers, networks and AI translated into 25 languages.\nFollowing the luncheon on Women in Power, Jayathma served as a panelist in the side event \n, which she co-hosted together with the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS). During this event, WAGGGS Youth Delegates made a moving performance to create awareness about the multiple implications of street harassment. Through personal stories, the participants led the hall to a deep immersion in street harassment experiences that took place in their home countries. This opened a space for reflection to start the discussions of the panel.\nThe rich discussion in the panel, moderated by Krishanti Dharmaraj, Executive Director for the Center for Women’s Global Leadership in Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences, explored street harassment as a manifestation of structural inequality and violence, as well as the mechanisms and possible solutions to ensure the safety of women and girls in the streets\nThrough a “talk show” format, Jayathma, along with Roseline Souebele Mayinga, WAGGGS Youth delegate and Advocacy Champion; Purna Sen, Spokesperson on Addressing Sexual Harassment and Other Forms of Discrimination for UN Women; and Keketso Maema, CEO of the Commission for Gender Equality in South Africa, discussed personal experiences and shared their recommendations for preventative measures and practical steps to be taken towards ensuring safe streets for all.\nOn Wednesday 14 March, youth events of the week culminated in a high-level intergenerational dialogue, where participants – including the Youth Envoy – were invited to take the “hot seat” and respond to questions relevant to the CSW theme posed by youth participants in the room.\nWhen it was her turn on the “hot seat,” Jayathma received several challenging questions from the audience. One young woman started off by asking, “how can you make sure and ensure that women with disabilities will be integrated and included in society?” “We need to increase investments to support those with disabilities,” Jayathma responded. “Often, the pushback is surrounding the price of these investments. I say, let it be expensive, it’s an investment we \n to make. If there is no space at the table, we need to make the table bigger.”\nBesides Jayathma herself, a number of speakers took the ‘hot seat’, including Ms. Marta Lucia Ramirez, Vice-President of Colombia; Ms. Nadine Gasman, Head of the National Institute for Women of Mexico; Adriana Salvatierra, President of Senate of Bolivia; Ms. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women; and Ms. Gunilla Carlsson, Deputy Executive Director of UNAIDs.\nH.E. Ms. Geraldine Byrne Nason, Chair of CSW and Permanent Representative of Ireland, was also in attendance. In her introductory remarks as Chair of CSW, Ms. Nason committed that she would speak to minimum standards, and to ask governments to “read them and heed them.” Today she announced that she has already delivered on her commitment and encouraged all the young people in the room to follow-up with their governments and do the same.\nThis intergenerational youth dialogue provided a critical platform where young CSW participants could discuss the Common Minimum Standards and its action-oriented recommendations, with policy makers, civil society and youth organizations to ensure the effective delivery of social protection, public services and sustainable infrastructure to young women and girls.\nTo wrap up, each year the principal output of the Commission on the Status of Women are concrete recommendations for governments, intergovernmental bodies, civil society, and other relevant stakeholders, to be implemented at all levels.

I just came back from my mission to Belgrade, Pristina and Addis Ababa with some exciting discussions.\nAt my first stop in Belgrade, I had the honor of meeting with the United Nations Country Team, and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. I’m so proud of the UNCT’s tireless work with the Government to address issues affecting young people, and of their effort in the implementation of the #Youth2030 strategy. I’m also very happy to learn about the Serbian government’s – including the Ministry of Youth and Sports – amazing contributions to support the Youth Strategy in partnership with the UN agencies on the ground, and other amazing work with local youth organisations and communities.\nI also had the chance to meet with the United Nations Association of Serbia and the Serbian Youth Delegates. They have so many great projects to create dialogue among young people and with the international community – thus enabling conversation and engagement for #Youth2030 and the #SDGs.\nI then arrived in Pristina and started my day by meeting with the UN Mission in Kosovo, which works closely with local youth organisations in trust-building activities. I also met with the UN Kosovo Team and learnt about their fantastic work for young people from facilitating meaningful youth engagement, to capacity building and training. I provided recommendations based on my observations to improve youth programmes carried-out by the United Nations in Kosovo. I look very much forward to working together with them and implement #Youth2030!\nThe discussion with the authorities in Kosovo was also fruitful! Together we talked about issues affecting youth – such as education, employment, and gender equality – as well as the importance of involving young people in finding solutions and realising them.\nI also had the pleasure of visiting Kamenica, a town East of Pristina, and met with young leaders of the Municipal Youth Action Council to learn about their cool initiatives and programmes in partnership with UN agencies. I felt so inspired to see young people unite regardless of ethnic and religious backgrounds. Respecting diversity is crucial to create meaningful dialogue and lead towards a harmonious future!\nAfter completing my journey in Kosovo, I flew to Ethiopia to take part in the Pan-African Youth Forum organised by the African Union. I felt very humbled & inspired to hear the resilience of the young people I met during the Forum. I am always amazed by the wonderful recommendations fellow young people propose to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\nAfrica is home to the force of 400 million young people. By investing on Education, Employment, Entrepreneurship, and Empowerment – the crucial 4 Es – the African Union Youth Programme and the 1 Million by 2021 Initiative, endeavour to empower young people to unlock Africa’s potential.\nDuring the Forum, I had the opportunity to meet with the recently appointed African Union Youth Envoy – my friend Aya Chebbi – together with the members of the AU Youth Advisory Panel. Under the same mission of empowering all youth, together we discussed plans to collaborate in the implementation of #Youth2030 and #1mBy2021 – and beyond!\nJust after visiting the AU, I met with H.E Ms. Yalem Tsegaye, Ethiopia’s Minister of Women, Youth and Children. We spoke about the Ethiopian Government’s priorities with regards to young people, and the close collaboration with the United Nations.\nBack at the United Nations, I met the UN Ethiopia Country Team, together with the Youth Advisory Panel. We discussed how the UN can better support youth and the government through innovative programmes to implement #Youth2030. There, I also had the chance to meet young beneficiaries from ILO programme, ILO gives psychological, educational & financial support to returned migrants who need to reintegrate. These young people showed me how they did not lose hope to start a new and better life, and I am truly humbled and inspired to hear their stories.\nFinally I also had the chance to meet Dr. Vera Songwe the Executive Secretary of ECA. We had a fruitful discussion on the inclusion of young people in the regional follow-up and review process of #SDGs.\nThis journey has been wonderful. It initiated great conversations with government officials, local UN agencies, and – most importantly – young people. I look forward to all our future collaborations and continue to make #Youth2030 a reality.\n \n"},

Today, the world is home to 1.8", "detail": "Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, Fellow young people,\nI would like to begin by thanking the Government of Bangladesh for inviting me to mark the International Youth Day 2018 with all of you here in Dhaka.\nToday, the world is home to 1.8 billion young people. Majority of them live in developing countries. This sub-region, South Asia which is home to you and I, is the home to a very large portion of the world’s young people.\nHaving a magnitude population of young people offers us a golden opportunity to accelerate sustainable development and achieve global peace and security; given the necessary policies are in place, substantial investments are made and conducive environments are created. Empowering today’s generation of young people is our only chance to end poverty, end hunger, bridge inequalities and reverse climate change.\nI would like to congratulate the Ministry of Youth and Sports and the government, for the successful nationwide vocational education and training programs that provide millions of young people with necessary skills to enter the labor market and start their own businesses. By “Connecting the Dots”, Programs like “Young Bangla” has become a launching pad for young individuals and youth-led organizations, supporting them with resources and capacity-building to innovate and contribute to the country’s development.\nThis year the theme for International Youth Day is “Safe Spaces for Youth.” Safe spaces are imperative to the development and realizing the rights of young people as they allow them to come together, participate in activities that suit their tailored and diversified needs, engage in open discussion, and freely express themselves.\nBefore discussing how to create safe spaces, let us start by addressing two critical questions: First, what are safe spaces? And Second, why is it important for young people to have them?\nWhile there are many types of spaces, safe spaces go beyond the conventional definition to ensure the dignity and safety of youth. These safe spaces consist of public, civic, physical, and digital spaces.\nPublic spaces offer young people the ability to engage in sports and leisure activities within their community. These spaces are of chief significance for they allow young people to congregate and develop their own communities outside of their homes. The World Programme of Action for Youth (WPAY), which is the UN framework for youth development, especially lists the availability of leisure activities as a priority to guaranteeing the psychological, cognitive, and physical development of youth.\nCivic spaces, on the other hand, permit young people and youth-led organizations and movements to participate effectively and constructively, in formal or informal ways, in political or non-political issues, whether on local, sub-national, national or international levels.\nThis includes advocating for youth rights, voting, volunteering, campaigning and more. Safe spaces allow all members of society – individuals and groups – to have the ability to exercise their basic civil rights freely, effectively and without discrimination.\nDigital spaces are now used as a medium by young people to engage in political, civic, and social dialogue. In many areas, the lessened capacity for safe public and physical places has led many young people to utilize digital spaces and social media for online communication, education platforms, experience virtual realities and even create social and political movements. As young people become increasingly connected through the technological world, the need for safe digital spaces becomes even more of a criticality.\nThere is a need to build on this momentum, but we must also be aware of the ramifications that accompany digital expansions. Digital platforms have become spaces for bullying and harassment, the spread of hate speech and a popular medium for recruiting young boys and girls to engage in terrorist and extremist movements. We should empower young people with the necessary information and skills to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.\nAnd lastly, physical spaces are necessary for accommodating the diverse needs of young people, especially those susceptible to marginalization and violence.\nViolence prevents so many aspects of women’s’ empowerment. If you deny their access to education, finance, work, sexual and reproductive health, and rights, that is a violence against women. Bangladesh has one of the highest rates of child marriage worldwide. According to UNICEF, one in five Bangladeshi girls get married before they turn 15.\nI have fond memories of meeting a young woman named Meghla a few months ago at the European Development Days, supported by World Vision’s Child and Youth Forum in Bangladesh. At the age of 13, she refused to get married despite immense family pressure and started advocating against child marriage. In the last five years, in addition to her own, she managed to stop 7 other children from being forced into marriage. Young women like Meghla represent the passion, drive and strong values of social justice embodied in young people. We should all support them in their fight by putting necessary laws and policies in place to protect young women and girls from harmful traditions and practices that derail them from achieving their fullest potential.\nIn our quest for the creation of safe spaces everywhere, I urge policymakers to take into consideration the gendered aspect of this situation. Young women and girls are particularly vulnerable to violence and sexual assault, disabled young people, minority youth groups and LGBTI young people continue to face discrimination and violence.\nFurther, we must equally acknowledge the marginalized communities, such as the migrants and refugees that surround us, and ensure their access to basic human rights as well.\nWe are thankful to the government and people of Bangladesh who have shown their true values of humanity to the world by opening its doors to over a million Rohingya refugees, when so many others are closing their borders. I call on the international community to join hands with the government of Bangladesh and other humanitarian actors to support Rohingya young people. They have seen and experienced violence and trauma unlike any other group and we need increased investments to provide safe spaces for their empowerment including the provision of basic education.\nAs many of you already know, it is, and has been, a particularly trying time for Bangladesh as many internal and external challenges continue to rise. Despite evident efforts and progress made over the past years, the Bangladeshi youth, especially young women and girls are truly being put to the test.\nWhen discussing safe spaces, I am particularly concerned by the violent incidents recently reported at the student protests demanding justice and solutions for road traffic accidents in Dhaka and other cities. Similar to Bangladesh, road traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for young people between 15-29 years worldwide. 2011-2020 was declared as the Decade for Action for Road Safety by the UN General Assembly in 2010. As we are pushing for the reduction and eradication of road traffic injuries and deaths before the end of the decade, I support the young people’s call for a better public transport system that provides a safe public space for young people and adults alike.\nI call on the government and all parties involved to ensure the safety of young people speaking out for a worthy cause and protect young people from the violence. I sincerely hope that the policymakers will listen to the young people voicing out their concerns and take the necessary steps to resolve these pressing issues. So that young people can be safe and can go back to school soon.\nIn the midst of worsening political and humanitarian catastrophes, social and economic inequalities widen, making safe spaces for youth scarcer than ever before. But without such spaces, it becomes increasingly difficult for young people to trust and believe in political institutions and constructively engage with them. Lack of safe and inclusive spaces hinders their ability to explore their creativity, innovation, and capacity to realize their fullest potential.\nInvesting in and providing safe spaces for adolescents and youth today will put Bangladesh on the right track towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals set out in the Agenda 2030 and also the goals outlined in the country’s 7th Five Year Plan. Fully engaged, educated, healthy and productive young people can help break multi-generational poverty, are resilient in the face of personal and societal threats, and as skilled and informed citizens can contribute effectively to the strengthening of their communities and nations.\nInternational Youth Day is about ensuring that young people all over the world are able to realize their fullest potential. We need to work towards this right now, and be conscientious of it every second of our day. The longer the wait, the longer we withhold our greatest investment from ourselves and our nations. Young people are calling on us to offer their creativity, innovation and positive contributions, let us not turn that call into a “missed call.”\nThank you for your time, and once again, Happy and Safe International Youth Day!\n \nWatch a summary of the event \n.\n"}
