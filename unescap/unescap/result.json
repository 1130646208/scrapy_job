Governments expressed their resolve today at the opening of the seventh Committee on Statistics, convened by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). \n“Targeting which segment of the population and sectors of the economy that are most affected by the huge impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic requires good data and statistics,” highlighted United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana in her opening remarks. She further underscored that a whole-of-government approach to data and statistics is essential. \n“At a time of crisis, governments must more than ever rely on timely, reliable data to make decisions to mitigate harm and support their citizens. In addition, given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our interconnected world, decisions made today will have consequences that will last far into the future, affecting people in every region and community,” shared Ms Wanpen Poonwong, Director-General, National Statistical Office, Thailand. \nShe added, “This is a crucial time for us to continue working together in the international statistical community to support each other. Timely, accurate and trusted official statistics are our best bet to ensure no one is left behind.” \nMr. Gogita Todraze, Executive Director, National Statistics Office of Georgia was elected as the Chair for the seventh session. He expressed his hope that the cooperation and active engagement of all delegates would generate concrete decisions that shape the future of statistics work in the region. \nThree priority topics for regional action will be discussed at the biennial intergovernmental Committee this year: accounting for integrated statistics and analysis, embracing big data to modernize official statistics and transforming human resources management. Delegates will also review progress on two overarching commitments for advancing statistics: the 2016 Collective Vision and Framework for Action by the Asia-Pacific statistical community and the 2019 Declaration on Navigating Policy with Data to Leave No One Behind . \nOn the sidelines of the Committee, the United Nations Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific (SIAP) also commemorated its 50th anniversary and launched a book celebrating the milestones of the Institute. Over the past 50 years, the Institute has trained over 21,000 statisticians and policy analysts from 145 countries and territories on producing timely and high-quality official statistics for development planning and decision making. \n“The COVID-19 pandemic is forcing the governments of many countries to completely change how they produce official statistics. I am sure statisticians are very busy planning and implementing innovative approaches to conducting statistical surveys sustainably, as well as responding to the demand for policymaking statistics to solve emerging challenges. In order to address these challenges, I believe the role of SIAP is becoming even more important,” said H.E. Ms. Takaichi Sanae, Minister for Internal Affairs and Communication, Japan. \nFor more information visit: https://www.unescap.org/events/committee-statistics-seventh-session \n"},

Ms. Helene Budliger Artieda, Ambassador of Switzerland. \nH.E. Budliger also highlighted the importance of tangible work, for instance to further enhance climate resilience in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Samoa; and to develop standard operating procedures for multi-hazard early warning in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam, as continuation of the Trust Fund work. She added, “Our vision is to expand the experiences of this pragmatic, result-oriented work to other beneficiary countries across the region.” \nThe Asia-Pacific region continues to be hit by a relentless sequence of disasters: cyclones, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, droughts, dust storms and heatwaves. These disasters strike without discrimination, but inflict the greatest damage in the poorest communities, including minority groups, people in remote areas and those on the margins of the region’s rapidly expanding cities. \nGiven the transboundary nature of disasters, no country alone can ensure effective early warning. Through regional coordination, the Trust Fund has reduced the total cost of establishing and maintaining early warning systems substantially compared to the sum of costs if each country had maintained its own system. \nThe Trust Fund continues to evolve and build on the opportunities offered by the new global and regional commitments to further scale up, share and replicate successful pilots in early warning systems through regional cooperation. Investments in these systems have brought substantial benefits in terms of economies-of-scale. The Trust Fund has also proven to be an effective vehicle for countries to access and share data, tools and expertise to support disaster resilience in the region. \nSince its inception in 2005, the ESCAP Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Tsunami, Disaster and Climate Preparedness has supported 29 projects with a budget of approximately $15.5 million and directly benefitted 19 countries. At the regional level, it has provided sustained financial support for the establishment of key initiatives that deliver cost-effective warning products and services, particularly for tsunamis and extreme weather systems. \nFor more information visit: https://www.unescap.org/disaster-preparedness-fund \n"},

Whether their impact is positive or negative overall will depend on the policies implemented today, the report authors say. \nThe report, “Shaping the Trends of Our Time,” finds that five years into implementation of the Sustainable Development Agenda, progress is already off-track and, in many instances may have even been reversed by the COVID-19 crisis. Policy commitments have not translated into policy actions. \nSustainable finance is increasing, but neither fast enough nor at the necessary scale. “The change in our behaviour and mindsets does not yet match our ambitions for sustainable development.” \nIssued on the eve of the 75 th UN General Assembly, the UN Economist Network’s report calls for a new, holistic way of designing policies in the 75 years to come. It argues for greater cooperation across seemingly unrelated areas, such as digitalization, urban planning and energy production, traditionally too often approached in isolation. The current deficiencies – or outright failures – in policies, the report authors warn, will inevitably result in negative impacts of megatrends. \nWithout an overhaul of the current disjointed policymaking, the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, the 15-year global objectives to improve the lives of people everywhere, is highly unlikely, according to the report. \n“Decades in the making, these megatrends cannot be easily undone or changed in any significant way in the immediate term. But they are the result of human activity, and therefore they can be shaped over time by consistent policies,” said Liu Zhenmin, head of the UN Department for Economic and Social Affairs that led the report preparation. \nFor example, decades of sustained and targeted policies have contributed to one of our lifetime’s biggest shifts in megatrends: the drastic changes in the world population. From a peak of 2% in the 1960s, average annual growth of the global population has slowed down to 1% at present and is expected to cease entirely by the end of the century. \nThe associated decrease in fertility rates can support greater gender equality, as women spend less of their lives in childbearing and childcare roles. On the other hand, rapid population ageing raises concerns about constraints on innovation, productivity and macroeconomic dynamism. \nSuch interlinkages, the new report argues, need to be carefully considered in policy design, not only within one megatrend, but across all of them. “Because each megatrend also affects the other megatrends, policy interventions in one area can generate positive and mutually reinforcing impacts in another,” said Liu Zhenmin. \nFor example, urbanization brings together all the factors necessary for technological innovation and productivity gains. And although urban centres generate most global greenhouse gas emissions and close to half of all waste, proper planning and control can overcome the damages to the environment and contribute to equity and sustainability. Managing these trade-offs is just as important as boosting cobenefits, the report argues. \nTechnological innovation and digitalization, for instance, have clearly accentuated income inequalities, especially in the time of online learning and remote work. And climate change can reinforce rural-urban migration by displacing hundreds of millions of people from coastal areas and from lands hit by drought. \nThe report stresses that international cooperation, and the United Nations, have a crucial role in framing the responses to the global megatrends, by encouraging domestic political consensus for sustained action. The UN can also assist in mobilizing the global support needed for individual countries, particularly those with fewer resources. \nAdditional quotes \nAchim Steiner, Administrator of UNDP: \n“In 2020, as a result of COVID-19, global human development is set to decline for the first time since the measure began. But as this megatrends report highlights, the pandemic has also moved the frontier of what is possible. In the face of crisis, countries are making bold choices to rapidly expand social protection, invest in a green economy, and close the digital divide, so that we can build forward better. \nThe report also issues a clear warning: recovery from crisis cannot be driven by a zero-sum game of economy versus environment. Rather, this is a once-in-a-generation chance to set things straight between people and the planet.” \nMaimunah Mohd Sharif, Executive Director of UN-Habitat: \n“The Report makes a strong case for integrated policy making based on an understanding of megatrends and their linkages. Integrated policies on sustainable urbanization, for example, can at once improve cities, advance technological innovation, promote climate action, manage ageing populations, and reduce inequalities.” \nInger Andersen, Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP): \n“Our continued destruction of ecosystems, biodiversity and wildlife has clear onsequences on global economic development. The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most severe manifestations of these consequences in recent history. More than half of the 169 targets for the 17 Goals relate directly or indirectly to nature; understanding that the relationship between people and nature is fundamental to sustainable development - and building policies that take this relationship into consideration at every level - is the key to a more prosperous, just and healthy world.” \nKunal Sen, Director of UNU-WIDER: \n“It is clear that the megatrends outlined in this report represent a threat to humanity’s prospects, but it is equally clear that the effects of global megatrends on the outcomes that people most care about are, to a large degree, influenced by policy actions and can be managed through concerted and cooperative efforts. I think the call for greater collaboration across disciplines is exactly what is needed to ensure decisive policy founded on the best available evidence. There is no doubt that inequality outcomes depend not just on rates of economic growth, but also on the dedication shown to inclusive transformations in the development of states, societies, and economies around the world.” \n= = = \nThe report can be found at http://bit.ly/UNmegatrends \nFor more information, please contact: \nBackground \nThe report Shaping the Trends of Our Time was prepared by the United Nations Economist Network under the guidance of Elliott Harris, UN Assistant Secretary-General for Economic Development and Chief Economist.

We cannot let this divide drive new forms of socio-economic inequalities.” \nMore than half of the region’s 4.1 billion people remain offline and in least developed, landlocked developing and Pacific island countries, less than 5 per cent of the population has access to high-speed and affordable Internet. Women and girls, regardless of location, level of income or age, have lower access than men. \n“We need to accelerate the digital transformation that has happened before the COVID-19 pandemic. We need to make sure that quality telecommunications infrastructure is made available,” said H.E. Mr. Bambang Brodjonegoro, Minister for Research and Technology and Chairman of the National Agency for Research and Innovation, Indonesia. \nTo leave no one behind, the Committee discussed a set of guidelines for inclusive technology and innovation policies for sustainable development, and committed to developing policies that promote inclusive technology and innovation to ensure that innovations are accessible, relevant and affordable for all. \n“It is our choice to look at global challenges such as the Coronavirus pandemic as an international science and technology competition or as an opportunity for a generous collaboration to build a better world,” said H.E. Mr. Sorena Sattari, Vice President for Science and Technology, Islamic Republic of Iran. \nThe Committee also underscored the importance of harnessing the entrepreneurial spirit of the private sector to focus on developing innovations to address social and environmental challenges as well as provide economic opportunities. Social innovators and entrepreneurs have stepped up in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. From providing educational technology and e-health services for the most vulnerable to developing community tracing initiatives, the work of social innovators and entrepreneurs is more critical than ever. \nIn this regard, the Committee recognized the critical role that innovative business models – such as social enterprise, inclusive business and impact investing – play in accelerating progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, and recommended that the United Nations support member States to grow this new and emerging sector. \nA regional launch of the 2020 United Nations E-Government Survey published by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) was held on the sidelines of the Committee. The Survey finds that among the world’s least developed countries, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Cambodia have become leaders in digital government development, advancing from the middle to the high E-Government Development Index group in 2020. At the launch, ESCAP further highlighted the challenges and opportunities of digital government in the Asia-Pacific region and emphasized the use of ICT during all phases of disaster risk management. \n\"This e-government development ranking allows us to see the readiness and capabilities of the country in the use of ICT to provide citizens with public services,\" said H.E. Mr. Ablaykhan Ospanov, Vice Minister of Digital Development, Innovations and Aerospace Industry, Kazakhstan. He further called on countries to actively cooperate on the development of a new Action Plan for implementation of the Asia-Pacific Information Superhighway 2022-2026, which will help ensure that digital government services reach all. \nIn conjunction with the Committee, a high-level dialogue session also gathered eminent personalities such as Special Adviser to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Mr. Fabrizio Hochschild, Maldives Minister of Communication, Science and Technology H.E. Mr. Mohamed Maleeh Jamal, Astronaut and Senior Advisor to the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Dr. Mukai Chiaki, Google Asia-Pacific Vice President for Government Policy Ambassador (ret.) Ted Osius and Alibaba Senior Director Mr. Sami Farhad to share their insights on how the region can accelerate digital connectivity and leverage innovation as part of its post-pandemic recovery efforts. The session kicked off a six-part Regional Conversation Series on Building Back Better in commemoration of the United Nations’ 75th anniversary this year. \n"},

North and Central Asia is likely to face the most severe contractions with ESCAP forecasting over 7 per cent contraction in GDP growth in 2020. The outbreak has further widened existing social inequalities especially among vulnerable groups. \n“Together, governments and all stakeholders need to work in formulating policies across social, economic and environment sectors to safeguards the delivery of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” said Ms. Alisjahbana. \nPresenting the keynote address, H.E. Mr. Rashid Alimov, former Secretary-General of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization said, “It is important to derive the right lessons from the current crisis and mobilise the potential for cooperation in the areas of health and education, food and biosafety.” \nIn commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, the Forum featured a High-Level Dialogue between Eminent Persons and Youth on shaping a common future in the final decade to reach the SDGs. Youth comprise 28,5 per cent of the population in North and Central Asia and are a key stakeholder group driving the endeavor to build back better. \n“The crisis circumstances surrounding the coronavirus pandemic have led to significant changes in education and science, but we see them as opportunities for development. During the pandemic, we gave priority to vulnerable children. Schoolchildren with special needs, from low-income, large families should not be affected by distance learning. Now is the time to fine-tune education policies and create inclusive opportunities for closer and more organic inclusion of the most vulnerable in the educational environment. Parents need support, as do students and teachers. The Ministry and the authorities must try to provide all conditions. No one should be left behind,” said H.E. Mr. Askhat Aimagambetov, Minister of Education and Science, Kazakhstan. \n“COVID-19 has tremendously affected all people in North and Central Asia, but we have to differentiate the impact on men and women separately and tailor necessary policies. I assume that boys and girls from rural regions should be one who receive the most attention when designing interventions,” shared youth representative Ms. Asel Kubanychbekova, Founder of the Women’s Entrepreneurship Development Fund, Kyrgyzstan. \nThe COVID-19 crisis has also highlighted the vulnerabilities of business as usual and offers opportunities to reshape and build a more sustainable, inclusive and resilient North and Central Asia. In that vein, Forum participants discussed good practices for response, recovery and policy considerations embedded into long-term development planning. They emphasized the essential role of regional cooperation and partnerships in kickstarting the regional economy while instilling necessary safety measures. Delegates agreed to enhance connectivity, digitalization and secure investments while putting people and planet first. \nHeld annually by ESCAP, the Subregional SDG Forum enables an inclusive dialogue among multiple stakeholder groups and provides unique subregional perspectives on current development challenges. This year, several organizations also shared results of new primary analyses of COVID-19 pandemic impacts on the subregion’s development efforts. Inputs from the Forum will feed into the main messages of the 2021 Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development as well as assist member States with Voluntary National Review (VNR) reporting and SDG implementation. \nFor more information visit: https://www.unescap.org/events/2020NCA_SDG \n"},

The new financing instrument supported by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) is a monumental step in tapping into the domestic resources market and preparing Bhutan to enter the international capital market. \nThe Royal Government of Bhutan has recently completed the offering of a 3-year bond Series RGOB001 of Nu. 3,000 million (or US$ 41 million) at an annual coupon rate of 6.5 per cent to support financing fiscal needs in responding to COVID-19 pandemic. The transaction was well-received and resulted in oversubscription of 300 per cent. The issuance was mainly dominated by financial institutions, while non-bank institutions such as pension and insurance companies as well as civil society organization also participated. The allotment will be based on a pro-rata basis. \n“Policymakers are tackling difficult choices over how to prioritize development spending, while continuing to expand their squeezed fiscal space. Exploring sustainability-oriented bonds and innovative financing instruments options for SDG investment should be explored further. Now is the time to capitalize on a proven idea to support a sustainable and resilient recovery from COVID-19,” said United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana. \n“Today the Royal Government of Bhutan successfully concluded its first-ever sovereign bond issuance for public subscription. This historical move has significantly expanded our fiscal management space while diversifying debt resources through opening up a new channel for long-term public borrowing. Taking this opportunity, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to ESCAP which has provided us valuable technical assistance on the issuance of the sovereign bond since 2017 through various modalities, such as policy advocacy, research studies, training workshops and study tours,” said Dasho Nim Dorji, Finance Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Royal Government of Bhutan. \nGerald Daly, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Bhutan said, “I congratulate Bhutan on the issuance of its first-ever sovereign bond and ESCAP on providing successful technical support to assist the Royal Government in this important work. With this bond, Bhutan has helped demonstrate how a capital market can be created in a small economy. The UN system stands ready to further support Bhutan in its efforts to mobilize financial resources and build resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond”. \nAt the request of the Royal Government of Bhutan, ESCAP began providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance, government agencies, and key stakeholders since 2017 to help facilitate the pre-issuance process of Bhutan’s first sovereign bonds. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided impetus for the government to take much-needed measures to support the economy, since the plan to issue the sovereign bond began years ago. \nThe innovative project in Bhutan serves as an example of how Least Developed Countries with underdeveloped financial infrastructure could issue sovereign bonds as a tool for economic recovery and capital market development. The bond issuance is a major step to independently finance Bhutan’s fiscal needs as the country normally relied on overseas development assistance (ODA) and concessional loans. \n"},

APTA represents the first regional trade agreement of Mongolia with developing countries. \nParticipation in APTA will enable Mongolia to enjoy reduced tariff barriers as well as enhance its market access to South, South-West and South East Asia as well as to China, the country’s biggest trading partner. It also provides Mongolia an opportunity to upgrade its capacity in trade negotiation and development and enhanced preparation for future negotiations with other trading partners in regional trade agreements. \n“This is the first expansion of APTA since China’s accession in 2001. It is an important milestone in the progress of APTA towards becoming a contemporary regional agreement. Simple and smooth implementation of APTA trade preferences demonstrates its members’ commitment towards utilizing trade for sustainable development. As the secretariat of APTA, ESCAP will continue its support service for the expansion of its membership and scope,” said United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana. \n“With its accession to the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement, Mongolia believes that this will help the country to further expand its trade and economic cooperation with the member nations, contribute to diversification of its economy as well as more active involvement in regional integration processes,” said H.E. Mr. Tumur Amarsanaa, Ambassador of Mongolia to the Kingdom of Thailand. \nEstablished in 1975 under the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), APTA is one of Asia’s oldest regional trade agreements. By depositing the instrument of accession, Mongolia will become the seventh member of the Agreement, which includes China and five original members: Bangladesh, India, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the Republic of Korea and Sri Lanka. \nAPTA aims to promote the economic development of its members through the adoption of mutually beneficial trade liberalization measures that contribute to regional trade expansion and economic cooperation. Currently, the Agreement is under its fifth round of negotiations to widen tariff preferences in trade in goods and expand areas of liberalisation in investment, services trade, and trade facilitation. It is also continuously working on improving and modernizing its Rules of origin for trade in goods. \nInitiatives like APTA pave the way for greater economic integration and development among the region’s landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). This heterogenous group of countries that vary significantly in economic size, population size and geographic features face deep structural impediments in their pursuit of sustainable development. \nMoving forward, ESCAP will organize a hybrid workshop in Mongolia on 12 October to support smooth implementation of APTA. During the workshop, the overview and details of APTA will be presented with member countries sharing experiences and opportunities. \nFor more information on the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement: https://www.unescap.org/apta \n"},

To counter these challenges, the report puts forth policy recommendations to strengthen the fisheries and tourism sectors as vital drivers for progress towards sustainable development. \n“Small island developing States can do more to embrace their blue economy to foster their sustainable development. Although fisheries and tourism are being significantly affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, they remain among the most important sectors for many SIDS in terms of their contribution to the economy and their importance for livelihoods,” said United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana. \nFisheries provide food and income to more than 200 million people in the Asia-Pacific region. The region also accounts for 84 per cent of the global population employed in the sector and brings in much needed public revenue to SIDS. However, one of the challenges that these Governments face in managing fisheries more sustainably is the lack of factual, transparent and harmonized data. The report calls for a stronger push for investments in producing relevant data, especially given the current limited statistical capacities in SIDS. \nSimilarly, tourism is one of the most economically viable sectors for SIDS. In 2018, the total value of international tourist receipts across the region’s 14 SIDS was $5.4 billion, which is equivalent to 13 per cent of their aggregated GDP. Among others, the report proposes for SIDS to promote green and blue tourism linked to local communities and local economies to address the challenges related to the sustainability of the tourism sector. It also suggests that green tax initiatives could be useful to increase revenues and address the risk of overexploitation. \nGreater regional cooperation is also an important element for creating an enabling framework. Regional cooperation is especially important given the nature of fisheries as a common property resource and the remote locations of most Asia-Pacific SIDS, which results in tourists usually willing to visit several countries within one trip. The ESCAP report further calls for Asia-Pacific SIDS to scale up actions for oceans by acting together to leverage their natural assets and to gain collective bargaining power. \nPublished annually, the Asia-Pacific Countries with Special Needs Development Report analyzes development challenges that are particularly pertinent to the region's 36 least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States. \nThe full report can be accessed at: https://www.unescap.org/publication-series/asia-pacific-countries-with-special-needs-development-report \n"},

The journey to recovery is not easy, but countries must resist the urge to go back to ‘business as usual’. There is a small window of opportunity for China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea to lead the global recovery efforts. To fight against the virus and build back better together, solidarity and cooperation are vital.” \n“China, Japan and the Republic of Korea have all successfully kept the outbreak of COVID-19 under control with low fatality rates by taking different strategies and measures. I hope their experiences can be widely shared within and beyond Asia and the Pacific to help countries flatten the curve,” shared Mr. Hisashi Michigami, Secretary-General of the Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat. \nHaving started as a public health crisis, the COVID-19 has brought the greatest economic crisis in all corners of the world. Socio-economic impacts of the pandemic are also threatening to reverse years of hard-won development gains in the region. Regional cooperation on COVID-19 responses as well as joint actions to support countries in building back better will be essential. \nDuring the webinar, experts shared different approaches and measures in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. In China, shelter hospitals enabled swift response to a massive surge of patients. Japan’s cluster-based approach of contact tracing helped identify infections more efficiently. Korean experiences showed that early implementation of nationwide massive testing is key to the containment of COVID-19. Panelists also highlighted the potential of regional cooperation for addressing infectious disease as well as measures for controlling a possible second wave of COVID-19. \nWith over 2,000 registered participants from 70 countries, the webinar featured Dr. Zunyou Wu, Chief Epidemiologist, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Hitoshi Oshitani, Professor, Tohoku University and member of the Japanese government’s advisory panel on COVID-19, Dr. Hyukmin Lee, Professor, Yonsei University and member of the Infectious Disease Control Committee of Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, sharing experiences in their countries.

The manual gives clear guidance to investment and gender professionals on assessing a company’s demonstrated commitment to gender equality by focusing on six performance criteria, namely pay equity, women’s workforce participation, gender diverse leadership and governance, benefits and professional development, safe and healthy workplace environment, and women-powered value chains. The tool identifies areas for organizational improvement and supports the development of a gender improvement plan. \nThe launch of the GES Manual took place at the closing session of the GenderSmart Virtual Programme today. On the occasion, Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP said, “Investing in women has the potential to accelerate the progress of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as we enter the Decade of Action. ESCAP is proud to be supporting SEAF to advancing gender lens investing in Asia.” \nSEAF Senior Managing Director Jennifer Buckley shared, “today, I am humbled with gratitude as I have witnessed a community coming together across the globe to generously share their expertise, knowledge and connections enabling us to reach a significant milestone in advancing women’s economic empowerment with the launch of the GES Manual. There is of course more work to be done, but we as a community, we should be proud of our collective efforts towards enabling women’s workforce participation and equity in business.” \nThe GES Manual is provided as a public good to support companies, organizations and/or funds to use for their due diligence and gender lens investing work, and to calculate a consistent and comparable gender score. \nSEAF, with support from ESCAP, has committed to support greater investor adoption of gender smart investing by supporting the harmonization of women’s economic empowerment frameworks and gender equality tools. ESCAP and SEAF recognize that the GES framework is not the only gender equality framework publicly available and are therefore working with the impact investment community to further publicize other tools/frameworks already on the market, which can also support the investment community. \nIn addition to SEAF’s partnership with ESCAP’s Catalyzing Women’s Entrepreneurship programme, which is funded by the Government of Canada through Global Affairs Canada, SEAF’s GES work has benefited from a number of partners and stakeholders including Catalyst at Large, Women of the World Endowment and members of the 2X Challenge and Gender Finance Collaborative, which is made up of 14 Development Finance Institutions. \nAbout ESCAP’s Catalysing Women’s Entrepreneurship Programme \nThis initiative is implemented under a regional programme initiative titled ‘Catalyzing Women’s Entrepreneurship: Creating a Gender-Responsive Entrepreneurial Ecosystem’ funded by the Government of Canada, through Global Affairs Canada, and implemented by ESCAP.

Robust regional cooperation, coordinated by ASEAN, has also resulted in South-East Asia reporting significantly lower confirmed COVID-19 cases and related deaths compared to most other global regions. \nThe UN Secretary-General’s Policy Brief: The Impact of COVID-19 on South-East Asia issued today however warns that these early successes must be translated into addressing the serious socio-economic setbacks which threaten to further deepen inequalities across the region. \n“As in other parts of the world, the health, economic and political impact of COVID-19 has been significant across South-East Asia — hitting the most vulnerable the hardest. The pandemic has highlighted deep inequalities, shortfalls in governance and the imperative for a sustainable development pathway. And it has revealed new challenges, including to peace and security,” shared UN Secretary General António Guterres, adding that while the region has much work to do, it also has formidable capacities at its disposal. \nThe new UN report examines how COVID-19 has affected eleven countries in South-East Asia and proposes action-oriented recommendations on mitigating immediate impacts and planning pathways out of the crisis. \n“The Brief highlights the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on vulnerable groups, particularly workers in the informal economy. The crisis is threatening to push them back into poverty and unemployment. Responding to the pandemic and delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals are closely interlinked. We need a future that is more equitable, sustainable and resilient,” noted United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana. \nMoving forward, four areas will be critical in the region’s plans for recovery: tackling inequality, bridging the digital divide, greening the economy, and upholding human rights and good governance. \nThe uneven landscape of social protection systems has placed tackling inequality at the centre of both short and long-term recovery efforts, according to the report. Increased investments to strengthen health systems and accelerate progress towards universal health care will be critical to support those excluded from formal policy and social protection measures. \nDigital technology has also proved to be a critical tool in response to the pandemic. However, the benefits it offers are beyond the reach of the 55 per cent of South-East Asia’s population who remain offline. A regionally coordinated and scaled up effort is needed to put in place next-generation infrastructure networks and ensure universal digital connectivity, highlights the Brief . \nThe crisis presents an opportunity for countries to re-orient their development towards sustainability particularly through green recovery packages. Stimulus packages should be directed to industries that are low-carbon, resource efficient and aligned with environmental and climate objectives. By phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, countries could finance most or all of their current stimulus packages. Such measures would create massive fiscal space and greatly boost low carbon alternatives such as renewable energy and energy efficiency. \nThe Brief further underscores that countries in South-East Asia and their leaders can play an important role in upholding human rights and good governance practices in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Leaders can leverage community-based organizations, promote inclusion, participation and unity; and speak out against discrimination. \nThe report is part of a series of policy briefs issued by the United Nations that examine the sectoral and geographical dimensions of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world. \nThe full policy brief can be accessed at: https://bit.ly/SEAPolicyBrief \nA recording of the media briefing by the ESCAP Executive Secretary can be viewed at: https://bit.ly/ESBriefing \n"},

The study finds that while micro enterprise financing in Samoa is accessible to much of the population, only 50 per cent of small and medium enterprise (SMEs) have obtained commercial finance. \nOn the occasion, Ms. Maiava Atalina Ainuu-Enari, Governor of the Central Bank of Samoa stated, “We greatly appreciate the support from ESCAP and the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) that has enabled these important MSME studies to be carried out. This support and studies assist in carrying out the mission of the CBS in fostering a sound and vibrant financial system for Samoa’s economic development. We look forward to taking these up with our key stakeholders and development partners to improve access to finance for MSMEs.” \n“We are pleased to be launching, alongside our partners the Central Bank of Samoa and UNCDF, the studies on MSME Access to Finance in Samoa. As we know, MSMEs make up a significant contribution to economic growth and job creation across Asia and the Pacific. However, they often encounter difficulties in accessing finance, with women owned MSMEs particularly underserved by financial institutions, due to economic and socio-cultural factors. This report identifies several concrete recommendations to bridge the financing gap,” said United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana. \nThe studies analyse the supply and demand of financial services for MSMEs within Samoa’s existing policy and regulatory frameworks and those required to better enable them to use financial services. The analysis also provides financial and non-financial recommendations to further support Samoa’s MSMEs. \nJudith Karl, Executive Secretary of UNCDF noted, “This report shows that there is considerable unmet demand for commercial finance from MSMEs in Samoa, including for women entrepreneurs, and it highlights useful measures to address constraints such as lack of collateral and weak business cases. Through our activities in the Pacific, UNCDF helps address some of these constraints by supporting MSMEs to leverage digital tools to improve and grow their businesses. We stand ready to continue our collaboration with ESCAP and the Central Bank of Samoa to further help MSMEs access capital and to address the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.” \nThe far-reaching socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 has also reached the shores of Samoa. In parallel, the UN bodies launched the COVID-19 Supplementary Report and Recommendations , focusing on immediate measures to address MSME needs at this critical time. The supplemental report further identified immediate measures to support both financial institutions and MSME borrowers to cope with the current challenges faced due to the pandemic. \nThe reports are part of ESCAP’s MSME Financing Series, undertaken with financial support from the Government of Canada, through Global Affairs Canada.

A joint video statement from the Asian and Pacific heads of six leading international organisations urged a focus on human and labour rights, the environment and the vulnerable - including children, women and indigenous peoples - when redesigning public and business policy responses and as global economic activity resumes. \nAccording to the statement, the post COVID-19 response should be seen as “an opportunity to …build back better, develop innovative solutions and create pathways to a more equal, inclusive and sustainable world.” \nThis year’s Responsible Business and Human Rights Forum takes place against a backdrop of unprecedented economic and social disruption caused by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Recent UN estimates are that more than 305 million jobs have been lost globally since the pandemic began and as many as 500 million people will be driven into poverty by the end of 2020, potentially undoing much of the progress achieved through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \nWhile many countries of Asia and the Pacific have seen success in limiting transmission and deaths from COVID-19, nearly all have paid a price in terms of increased unemployment, insecurity and poverty. Women, children and migrant workers are among those most likely to suffer as losses cascade through the region. \nOver the next three days, the event aims to take stock of the virus’ impact and discuss challenges and opportunities for advancing responsible business and human rights in the region. Subjects under discussion include implementing national action plans for business and human rights, the implications for international trade, mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on workers and their communities, tackling gender bias and women’s burden of care in recovery plans, protecting human rights defenders, and assessing policy responses for migrant workers. The Forum will also see regional companies share their experiences in goal setting and driving action on climate change. \nNormally held in Bangkok, the Forum this year is virtual, with participants connecting on a dedicated internet platform. Interest has been high, with more than 5000 delegates from governments, business, civil society organizations and workers’ groups signing up for the 35 sessions and side events. \nHosts of the UN Responsible Business and Human Right Forum include the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights (UNWG), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). \nFor more information or to follow discussions live, see www.rbhrforum.com \nOr contact: \nKavita Sukanandan, + 66 2 288 1869 sukanandan@un.org Pete Forster +61 417 805 890 forsterw@iloguest.org Shima Islam, +66 (0) 2 356 9407 ssislam@unicef.org Bovornpong Vathanathanakul, +66 86 397 3369, b.vathanathanakul@unwomen.org \n"},

The forum concluded that the future of the region will be dictated by how countries respond to the pandemic and how well these responses are aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \nThe two organizations also organize the Asia-Pacific Trade Facilitation Forum and collaborate across many other areas, such as the Thematic Working Group on Gender Equality and on the Asia Pacific Climate Week. ADB is looking to expand cooperation with ESCAP on areas including gender inequality, climate change, ocean pollution, and boosting quality infrastructure. \nESCAP recently announced a framework of support to member States as they respond to the socioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework centers on three streams of work: (i) supporting sustainable and inclusive economic recovery through fiscal and monetary stimuli in line with the 2030 Agenda and Paris Agreement; (ii) protecting and investing in people and enhancing resilience of societies and communities, especially women and vulnerable groups of population; and (iii) restoring and building resilience in supply chains through regional and subegional coordination on trade, investment, transport and digital  connectivity and supporting small and medium enterprises. The framework also encourages countries to seize the opportunity to protect the environment by reducing pollution, supporting decarbonization and energy efficiency, and combating climate change. \nESCAP serves as the United Nations’ regional hub promoting cooperation among countries to achieve inclusive and sustainable development.

It is causing disruption and human suffering around the world. Its far-reaching social, economic and multidimensional impacts will be felt across all corners of the globe for some time to come. The measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in reduced demand, struggling service sectors, falling commodity prices and millions of jobs lost, pushing people into unemployment and poverty. Trade is expected to fall steeply in every region of the world and across all sectors of the economy. Global freight transport volumes in 2020 could be reduced by more than a third compared with estimates foreseen without COVID-19. \nNowhere are the risks of this health crisis turning into a development crisis higher than in the most vulnerable countries in the world, which are ill equipped to deal with the fallout from this pandemic. The Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs) are amongst the most vulnerable countries facing binding constraints to growth and development, including isolation from global markets, dependence on transit neighbours, small size, lack of productive capacities, structural challenges and vulnerability to external shocks. \nWhile it may appear that LLDCs have been less exposed to COVID-19, it is important to remember that the situation is constantly evolving, with confirmed cases on an upward trajectory in many countries. Low levels of health spending and low capacities present unique challenges to many LLDCs in effective testing, containment and eventual treatment. At the same time, the economic and social conditions are deteriorating rapidly in many LLDCs, mostly as a result of the domestic lockdown measures and international restrictions on the movement of people and goods. Given already existing challenges, a large informal sector and limited safety net schemes, the socio-economic effects on LLDCs could be severe. \nThe impacts of a combined lockdown measures, health pandemic and a global recession will likely halt or potentially even reverse LLDCs’ progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals and the aspirations included in the Vienna Programme of Action for the LLDCs for the Decade 2014-2024. \nLLDCs are particularly vulnerable to cross-border restrictions and border closures, given their dependency on transit transport to access international markets. Even in normal times, functioning and efficient transport networks and transit procedures are particularly critical in increasing connectivity and integration of the LLDCs in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America into world markets. In these unprecedented times, there is an even more urgent need to ensure smooth transport of goods to and from these countries. Transit transport is critical for LLDCs in both the short-term health response to the crisis by ensuring the delivery of much-needed medical equipment and basic goods, and the long-term economic response by facilitating trade and access to global markets and spurring economic pick-up post COVID-19. \nWhereas most of the transport measures introduced in response to COVID-19 have exempted movement of essential commodities, while introducing necessary sanitary and health requirements, this does not mean that cargo has been able to move freely across borders. Border closures, travel restrictions and heightened screenings have resulted in long queues at land borders and congestions at ports and airports across the world. In order to help reduce delays and keep vital supply chains up and running, UNECE supported by the other regional commissions and organizations created an online “Observatory on Border Crossings Status due to COVID-19”, which provides a real-time overview of up-to-date information regarding freight border crossing limitations globally. \nIn some countries, infrastructure at inland border-crossing points is extremely precarious, not only posing additional challenges to the processes at borders, but also exposing staff to higher contagion risks. The COVID-19 pandemic has also already begun to generate negative impacts on imports from LLDCs. \nThe decreased operation of port services, as a consequence of the pandemic, has also generated substantive increases in maritime logistics costs, impacting the costs of land transportation and, ultimately, affecting the cost of products to the final consumers. Given that LLDCs already face higher costs when compared to other countries, the consequences of COVID-19 are even more detrimental to their competitiveness in international markets. \nThe COVID-19 crisis demands decisive action now. \nFacilitating smooth movement of goods and keeping borders open for trade is fundamental. We call on Governments and organizations in the regions to collaborate to keep cross-border transport corridors and regional transport networks open as much as possible, while protecting public health. \nFirst of all, we call on the Governments to refrain from any unjustified restraints on traffic and goods in transit to make sure that goods can depart from and reach the LLDCs when needed, without delay or hinderance. It is critical that border clearance procedures for medical equipment and basic goods and commodities to LLDCs are simplified and fast-tracked. Ensuring transparency and information availability about import, export and transit procedures is essential in order to secure the smooth flow of goods. We encourage LLDCs and transit partner countries to make trade and transit related information available on the internet, including by making use of centralized online Trade Information Portals. \nSecond, now is the time for LLDCs and neighbouring countries to make use of trade facilitation standards and digital technologies that limit physical checks in transit, physical contact at borders and protect the health of workers, such as electronic exchange of information and paperless solutions. The accelerated implementation of the eTIR International System which ensures contactless and paperless border crossing operations, the use of electronic consignment notes such as eCMR allowing electronic tracking and tracing of goods and vehicles, automation of customs procedures through the ASYCUDA system, implementation of digital freight corridors and many other initiatives underway have reached momentum now. Policies and procedures that prevent unnecessary and systematic stopping of trucks at all borders need to be implemented. The implementation of international conventions such as the Revised Kyoto Convention, the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, the TIR Convention, the Harmonization Convention and other relevant legal instruments are of utmost importance in these times to facilitate transit transport. \nThird, governments around the globe need to respond to this pandemic not only by minimizing disruptions to international transport but also by viewing the crisis as an opportunity to reorient international freight transport operations towards a more sustainable path. In doing so, they should capitalize on the strengths of different modes of transport and address the obstacles that LLDCs are facing along the supply chains. For example, the distinctive features of railway transport, such use of less manpower over long distance, efficiency and environmental performance are working to its advantage in the current situation, in particular in Euro-Asia. In this regard, the use of international railway transport should be further encouraged and facilitated. \nFinally, global and regional cooperation on transport connectivity needs to be strengthened. Regional and global value chains and transport systems and services to and from LLDCs have to be sustainable, affordable and resilient to help them respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and future disruptions of similar nature. In the spirit of solidarity and building on the progress achieved in line with the Vienna Programme of Action for LLDCs, strengthening of regional cooperation between LLDCs and transit countries, in particular on transit and transport along important corridors and promoting public and private partnerships is now more critical than ever. Public and private stakeholders are urged to work closely together to facilitate transit, trade and transport and maintain functioning of supply chains and cross-border freight operations. \nThe UN system stands ready to continue its support to LLDCs and their trading partners by offering analytical and methodological tools and best practices, providing capacity building and, above all, supporting systematic global and regional dialogue on the challenges faced by LLDCs and opportunities for impactful actions. \nFekitamoeloa Katoa ‘Utoikamanu Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS \nMukhisa Kituyi Secretary-General of UNCTAD \nVera Songwe Executive Secretary of UN ECA \nOlga Algayerová Executive Secretary of UN ECE \nAlicia Bárcena Ibarra Executive Secretary of UNECLAC \nArmida Salsiah Alisjahbana Executive Secretary of UN ESCAP \n"},

Asia and the Pacific is poised to build back better after COVID-19 with stronger, more empowered national statistical offices supporting inclusive societies. They are innovating and embracing digital transformations,” emphasized United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana at the closing session. \n“Official statistics provide governments, businesses and civil society with the indispensable information they need to make good decisions. And they give people and their representatives the tools to have informed debates, to make choices and to hold decision makers to account. The Asia-Pacific Statistics Week is a wonderful example of the reach of official statistics in Asia and the Pacific,” shared President of the International Association for Official Statistics Mr. John Pullinger. \nThe forum focused on progress made towards the Asia-Pacific Collective Vision and Framework for Action for advancing official statistics for the 2030 Agenda under five action areas. It discussed empowering national statistical systems to meet urgent and evolving statistical needs by strengthening statistical skills, modernizing statistical business processes, legal and institutional structures, and engaging users. \nWhile the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has placed greater demand for a wider scope of statistics, many countries in the region continue to struggle with getting the basics such as population and economic statistics right. Participants highlighted the increasing need for regional substantive support in this area, and for more data integration to support analysis of sustainable development issues. They also underscored the importance of engaging users to make national statistical systems more responsive and able to develop strategies for better-informed policy decisions. \nHeld annually since 2016, the Asia-Pacific Statistics Week is a key forum in the region that provides a platform for knowledge sharing among practitioners involved in the production and use of statistics. \n"},

In this backdrop, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the agricultural sector has brought unprecedented challenges. The pandemic threatens to not only stagnate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals including Goal 1 (No Poverty) and Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), but has the potential to reverse the gains made in recent years, thus jeopardizing the global community’s shared promise to ‘leave no one behind’. Sustainable agricultural mechanization can play a key role in supporting countries in the region respond to the crisis. \nA webinar on Impact of COVID-19 on Agriculture in the Asia-Pacific Region and Role of Mechanization was organized on 18 June 2020 by the Centre for Sustainable Agricultural Mechanization of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP-CSAM). The webinar discussed how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the agricultural sector in Asia and the Pacific, and how the region can support recovery and build resilience to future crises through sustainable mechanization. \nOpening the webinar, Mr. Kaveh Zahedi, Deputy Executive Secretary of ESCAP, said “In the span of a few months, there is virtually no aspect of human life that has been left untouched by the COVID-19 pandemic. As is so often the case with crisis, the pandemic has hit the poor, the vulnerable, and the marginalized disproportionately hard, depriving people of lives as well as livelihood.” In the context of impact of COVID-19 on agriculture, he remarked “Sustainable agricultural mechanization is among the solutions that can strengthen the resilience of the farming community to crisis.” \nDuring the webinar, experts from Thailand and Sri Lanka presented country-level perspectives on the impact of the pandemic on agriculture including, for instance, difficulties in timely marketing and sale of agricultural produce, and restrictions on transportation and trade. Panelists from the Republic of Korea and China also highlighted the potential of innovation, particularly in the areas of ICT-enabled mechanization and post-harvest mechanization, in enabling recovery from the crisis and building long-term resilience of farmers in the region. \nThe webinar, which was broadcast live on YouTube to over 1,000 viewers, concluded by underscoring the need for response measures to be inclusive and to address the needs of smallholder farmers, rural women, elderly workers and youth. It also reiterated the key role of regional exchange and cooperation during this time. \nFor more information, please visit: http://www.un-csam.org/news_detail.asp?id=554 \nFor media enquiries, please contact: Centre for Sustainable Agricultural Mechanization (CSAM) Beijing, China Tel: (86-10) 8225 3580/81/82/85 E: info@un-csam.org \n"},

Although there are significant uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, the negative impacts are likely to be substantial. \nAs governments respond to the unprecedented health crisis and introduce economic stimulus packages, the report estimates that Asia-Pacific developing countries should increase health emergency spending by $880 million per year. The Survey also calls on Asia-Pacific countries to consider establishing a regional fund to respond to future health emergencies. \nThe ESCAP report suggests that, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers should maintain accommodative macroeconomic policies to sustain the economic health of the region. Fiscal and monetary policies should be focused on supporting affected enterprises and households and preventing economic contagion. Fiscal spending can also play a significant role in enhancing the ability of health responders to monitor the spread of the pandemic, care for infected people and improve health emergency preparedness. \nAt the same time, countries should take the opportunity posed by these challenging times to rethink their economic development strategies towards a more inclusive, sustainable and planet-friendly economy. Countries in the region are not only going through a public health crisis but also a climate emergency, which is permanent and even more far-reaching and potentially more disastrous than the pandemic. \n“Policymakers should not lose sight of people and the planet. When it comes to designing economic stimulus packages, social inclusiveness and environmental sustainability must be built into every decision,” said United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana. \nThe ESCAP report further reveals that the decades-long high economic growth in the region has been accompanied by growing inequality of income and opportunity, and detrimental impacts on the planet, which are endangering the well-being of present and future generations. Unsustainable consumption and production patterns have substantially increased greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating the vulnerability of the region to climate change. Additionally, $240 billion worth of annual subsidies continue to feed the region’s heavy dependence on fossil-fuels. \nThe Survey calls for a transition towards sustainable consumption and production, with cleaner production and less material-intensive lifestyles, supported by enabling policies. This would require all stakeholders, notably Governments, businesses and consumers, to urgently align their own goals and actions with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \nThe report urges strengthening of regional cooperation to raise the ambition to tackle climate emergency. Governments should scale up their efforts on climate-related standards, carbon pricing and implement sustainable consumption and production patterns at the regional level. \nProduced annually since 1947, the Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific is one of the longest-running United Nations reports on the region’s progress.

However, a new report released today by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) suggests that the temporary shutdown of activities as well as reduced human mobility and resource demands due to the COVID-19 pandemic may provide marine environments the much-needed breathing space for them to recover. \nThe report entitled Changing Sails: Accelerating Regional Actions for Sustainable Oceans in Asia and the Pacific also suggests that large-scale recovery investments being put in place by governments have the potential to turn the tide towards improving marine sustainability and resilience in the post-COVID 19 world if they catalyse a shift towards sustainable practices such as green shipping and decarbonization, and low-impact fisheries, aquaculture and tourism. \n“Promoting the health and sustainability of oceans is inextricably linked with the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific. During these challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to take advantage of the window of opportunity offered by reduced emissions and energy demand to protect the marine environment,” shared United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana at the report launch today. \n“Many of the challenges in the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and marine resources lie in the transboundary and highly complex nature of ocean management, coupled with the fragmented understanding of the interaction between oceans and human activities,” added Ms. Alisjahbana. \nOceans are extremely valuable for Asia and the Pacific, a region that uses them intensely. For example, fisheries provide food and income to more than 200 million people in the region, with 34 million engaged in commercial fishing. More than 80 per cent of international trade is transported by shipping with two thirds of these operations concentrated in Asia. However, countries in the Asia-Pacific are among the world’s top plastic polluters. Eight of the ten rivers responsible for up to 95 per cent of plastic waste leaked globally into oceans are in Asia. \nThe study dives into three key areas – maritime connectivity, sustainable fisheries and marine plastic pollution – around which the region can rally to take urgent action to halt and reverse the declining health of oceans and marine ecosystems. \nA startling lack of data and statistics on oceans in the region is revealed in the report, with data only available for two of the ten targets for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14: Life Below Water. At the same time, the data gaps are uneven, often being the largest in countries where they are needed the most. To transform actions for the oceans, the report urges for more transparent sharing of ocean data and stronger investments in national statistical systems to resolve existing blind spots. \nESCAP also underscores the need for countries in the region to take advantage of scientific and technological advances, and to consistently enforce international conventions, norms and standards on the protection and sustainable use of the oceans such as those by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and UN Environment Programme (UNEP). \nThe UN body further highlights the importance of strengthening regional cooperation between countries at different stages of development to live up to this shared responsibility. It points to existing platforms such as the Asia-Pacific Day for the Ocean to rally multi-stakeholder partnerships. Regional dialogue is also essential to support the connectivity and data needs of Pacific small island developing states, which currently remain isolated from beneficial global and regional maritime trade. \nThe report is released in line with the theme of the 76th Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, which will be held on 21 May. For the first time in ESCAP’s history, the Commission session will take place fully online with the participation of Ministers, senior government officials and various stakeholders from 53 member States and 9 associate members. \nThe full report can be accessed at: www.unescap.org/publications/changing-sails-accelerating-regional-action-sustainable-oceans-asia-and-pacific \nFor media enquiries, please contact: Ms. Kavita Sukanandan, Public Information Officer Strategic Communications and Advocacy Section, ESCAP T: (66) 2 288 1869 / E: sukanandan@un.org \n"},

Its recommendations are based on joint research and analysis from the UN System, the International Monetary Fund, World Bank Group, and more than 60 UN agencies and international institutions. \nEven before the outbreak of COVID-19, one in five countries – home to billions of people living in poverty – were likely to see per capita incomes stagnate or decline in 2020. Now, billions more are likely to be affected as governments struggle to cope with the pandemic. \n“The global community was already falling behind in efforts to end poverty, take climate action and reduce inequalities,” said Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Amina Mohammed. “COVID-19 is the first of its kind development emergency and all countries must rise to the challenge to save lives and safeguard livelihoods in our response and recovery. We have one chance to build back better together for people and for the planet.” \nDue to the COVID-19 crisis, global financial markets have witnessed heavy losses and intense volatility over the last month. Investors have moved around $90 billion out of emerging markets -- the largest outflow ever recorded. \nParticularly alarming is the prospect of a new debt crisis, compounded by tumbling prices for oil and other key commodities. Many Least Developed Countries (LDCs) were already at high risk of debt distress -- and the fall-out from the current crisis could significantly increase the number. \nIn Asia and the Pacific, the 2020 Financing for Sustainable Development Report highlighted that the Covid-19 crisis has further subdued investment growth and tax revenues. Furthermore, a recent Survey by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic may cost the region 0.8 percent of the gross domestic product, an estimated 172 billion U.S. dollars due to a massive drop in global demand for their exports alone. \n“To tackle COVID-19 in developing Asia-Pacific countries, ESCAP calls for an estimated increase in health emergency spending by $880 million per year through to 2030,” said Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana. \n“Fiscal support will be crucial in enhancing health responders’ ability to monitor the spread of the pandemic and caring for infected people,” she added. \nThe 2020 Financing for Sustainable Development Report calls for the following urgent actions: • Prevent a debt crisis by immediately suspending debt payments from LDCs and other low-income countries that request forbearance. Official bilateral creditors must lead, and others should consider similar or equivalent steps to provide new finance; • Reestablish financial stability by providing sufficient liquidity, and strengthening the global financial safety net, especially for emerging markets; • Contain the sharp fall in economic activity and support countries most in need through a globally coordinated response: expanding public health spending; social protection; keeping small businesses afloat; government transfers; debt forbearance and other national measures – and significantly increasing access to concessional international financing. • Promote trade and stimulate inclusive growth by eliminating trade barriers that restrict supply chains. \n“We are far from having a global package to help the developing world to create the conditions both to suppress the disease and to address the dramatic consequences in their populations,” said UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, during the recent launch of his Report on the Socioeconomic Impact of COVID-19. \n“What is needed is a large-scale, coordinated and comprehensive multilateral response amounting to at least 10 per cent of global GDP,” he added. \nBeyond the immediate crisis response, the COVID-19 pandemic should be the impetus to sustain the gains and accelerate implementation of long-overdue measures to set the world on a more sustainable development path and make the global economy more resilient to future shocks. \nThe 2020 Financing for Sustainable Development Report contains key actions needed for this purpose: • accelerate long-term investment in resilient infrastructure for sustainable development, through public investment and incentives for the private sector; • increase investment in risk management and preparedness; • strengthen social protection; • enhance regulatory frameworks, e.g. to discourage excessive private borrowing when debt is not intended for productive investments (vs. increasing shareholder returns); • strengthen the international financial safety net and framework for debt sustainability. \nThe report also provides policy options to harness the potential of digital technologies. These technologies have come to the forefront amid the COVID-19 outbreak, with lockdowns and physical distancing becoming the norm. Digital communication tools have also helped sustain interaction and continuity in vital economic and educational activities. However, access to digital technologies remains highly unequal within and between countries. Almost half the global population (46.4 per cent of people) does not have access to the Internet. \nThe COVID-19 crisis provides a timely example of the potential of digital technologies, but also highlights gaps and new challenges and risks. Many workers in the platform or ‘gig economy’ are poorly protected against massive income losses in a recession, with social protection systems often ill-equipped to address their needs. The report addresses these gaps and other opportunities and challenges of digital finance. \nThese and other policy responses should be sustained, sustainable and equitable, to avoid a rerun of the protracted and slow recovery from the 2008 crisis -- and ensure implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, Paris Agreement and achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. \n“Only a collective response, inspired by shared responsibility and solidarity, will suffice to address the unprecedented challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Liu Zhenmin, Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs and Chair of the Task Force that issued the report. “Governments, development partners, the private sector and other stakeholders must work together to combat COVID-19 and support every effort to address its social and economic impacts,” he added. \nFull copy of the report: bit.ly/fsdr2020 \nFor further information, please contact: \nKate Donovan, UN DESA, FSDO E-mail: kathryn.donovan@un.org Mobile/WhatsApp: 1 718 362 0606 \nKavita Sukanandan, UN ESCAP, SCAS Email: sukanandan@un.org Tel: +66 2288 1869 \nBackground: The report is a joint product of the Inter-agency Task Force on Financing for Development, which is comprised of more than 60 United Nations Agencies and international organizations. The Financing for Sustainable Development Office of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs serves as the substantive editor and coordinator of the Task Force, in close cooperation the World Bank Group, the IMF, WTO, UNCTAD, and UNDP. The Task Force was mandated by the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and is chaired by Mr. Zhenmin LIU, Under-Secretary General for Economic and Social Affairs. The full copy of the report and the annex will be uploaded to: https://developmentfinance.un.org/ This report is the basis for discussions at the ECOSOC Forum on Financing for Development where Member States agree on measures necessary to mobilize sustainable financing. This is year, the Forum process has been modified, while the SDG Investment Fair, which brings together government officials and investors, has been cancelled.

Collected through hundreds of conversations and an online survey, the data is part of the United Nations’ 75th anniversary initiative (UN75). Launched in January 2020, UN75 is the largest exercise mounted by the Organization to gather public opinion and crowdsource solutions to global challenges. \nNew York , April 20, 2020. As the whole UN system unites to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, the Organization is also scaling up its efforts to give voice to the global public through its 75th anniversary initiative (UN75). Launched in January, UN75 will run throughout 2020, to give all people the opportunity to shape global priorities by participating in a UN75 dialogue or completing a one-minute survey available at un75.online . [1] \nPreliminary findings, based on data collected between 1 January 2020 and 24 March 2020, were published today [2] on www.un.org/en/un75/news-events : \n1. An overwhelming majority—95%--of respondents agreed on the need for countries to work together to manage global trends , with a noticeable uptick from late February, as the upheaval caused by COVID-19 spread around the world. Support cut across all age groups and education levels. Ideas on strengthening international cooperation included more effective partnerships with civil society and the private sector, and greater involvement of women, youth, indigenous peoples and vulnerable groups in policymaking. 2. Climate and environment topped the list of issues that will most affect humanity’s future – with more than double the responses of any other issue. Conflict and violence came second, and health risks third, having risen sharply since early March. 3. The top five future priorities that emerged were: environmental protection, protection of human rights, less conflict, equal access to basic services, and zero discrimination. “I look forward to our continued efforts to ensure a meaningful observance of the seventy-fifth anniversary of our Organization, and to use this milestone for reflection on the multilateral cooperation the world needs at this time, both in addressing the immediate pandemic and in achieving the longer-term goals for which the United Nations was founded.” – United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres \nNotes [1] Launched by the UN Secretary-General, the UN’s 75th anniversary initiative is markedly different from previous commemorations, with less emphasis on communicating the UN’s successes and a strong focus on listening to the global public, especially young people. Over the course of 2020, the UN75 team will gather public perspectives on global challenges and solutions on how to tackle them through a one-minute survey (in 53 languages) and dialogues – now overwhelmingly online – organised by partners across the world. This data will be complemented by representative polling; academic research; and media and social media analysis in some 70 countries. The results will be presented in September 2020, at the official commemoration of the UN’s 75th anniversary, after which UN75 will focus on how best to take them forward, with a final report to be published in January 2021. \n[2] The data used was gathered between 1 January and 24 March 2020. During this period, 35,556 in 186 UN Member States took the one-minute survey online, in addition to 5,688 who participated through mobile applications. Over 330 dialogues took place in 87 UN Member States, with 56 summaries from 32 of them included in this preliminary analysis. \nRead the UN75 Update in full at: https://www.un.org/en/un75/news-events Join the UN75 conversation at: www.un.org/UN75 \n"},

While being the resource for some of the region’s key economic sectors, such as seaborne trade, fisheries and tourism, oceans are also the source of well-being, culture and identity for thousands of coastal communities. The conditions of oceans are inextricably linked to the pathways of sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific. Various indicators, however, are suggesting that the oceans are becoming more fragile with the pressing impacts of climate change, marine pollution and unsustainable economic practices. \nProduced in line with the 76th Session of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, this report examines three key areas – maritime connectivity, sustainable fisheries and marine plastic pollution – around which regional platforms can rally cross-sectoral solutions for the oceans. Among others, the study also draws attention to the lack of data and statistics on the oceans, growing demand for moving towards inclusive and green maritime shipping, deteriorating fish stocks and gaps in fishery management, and mounting pressure of marine plastic pollution in the region. \nWatch live at 11:00 (Bangkok Time) on the 13th of May on YouTube and ask your questions on the live chat or by email at escap-scas@un.org . \nNote: Questions for the briefing or media interview requests with ESCAP spokespersons may be sent ahead to escap-scas@un.org. \n"},

To do this, the project will leverage innovative technologies such as remote sensing, satellite and crowdsourced data applications to detect and monitor the sources and pathways of plastic waste entering rivers in urban catchment areas. Four ASEAN cities will pilot the project: Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Surabaya, Indonesia; Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand and Da Nang, Viet Nam. \n“Cities are on the front line in addressing plastic waste in ASEAN, which is the world’s most polluting region when it comes to ocean plastics. The proliferation of plastic pollution in our oceans is a serious climate change hazard, and thanks to the strong support of the Government of Japan, this innovative new project comes at a timely moment to accelerate action on the issue,” said United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana. \nFast growing cities in South East Asia are responsible for as much as 60 per cent of plastic waste leakage into the environment. 75 per cent of land-based sources of marine plastic pollution in the region originates from uncollected waste and 25 per cent from leakages in the municipal waste management systems. Plastic pollution is also transboundary - up to 95 per cent of plastic in our ocean is transported by ten major rivers, eight of which are in Asia. \nThe project will produce plastic waste maps and simulations for each pilot city and will train officials and stakeholders in ASEAN cities to use smart technologies to monitor, assess, report on and sustainably manage plastic waste as well as further strengthen municipal solid waste management systems. Urban policy makers will also be provided the tools and knowhow to develop policy and investment strategies which apply a circular economy approach in managing their plastic waste streams. \nThe need for regional cooperation to address this critical issue was recognized by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in his statement following the G20 Osaka Summit: “Marine plastic litter is another issue which cannot be resolved by some countries alone. Under such circumstances, the fact that the G20 was able to unite and share the Osaka Blue Ocean Vision, which aims to reduce additional pollution by marine plastic litter to zero by 2050, represents a major step forward towards resolving this issue.” \nThe ‘Closing the Loop’ project supports local implementation of the ASEAN Framework of Action on Marine Debris and the G20 Osaka Blue Vision to tackle the proliferation of plastic litter, both of which accelerate action towards the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and 14 (Life Below Water). \nThis ESCAP - Japan initiative is implemented in close collaboration with local and national governments in South East Asia, ASEAN, the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) and other partners. \nFor further information, visit: https://www.unescap.org/projects/closing-the-loop \nFor media enquiries, please contact: Ms. Kavita Sukanandan, Public Information Officer Strategic Communications and Advocacy Section, ESCAP T: (66) 2 288 1869 / E: sukanandan@un.org \n"},

The two organisations will offer recommendations to governments in the region positioning the energy transition as an integral part of the immediate response to the crisis and medium to long-term recovery efforts. \nAsia-Pacific, home to half of the world’s population, is largely dependent on fossil fuels. Diesel, for instance, fuels the majority of the region’s off-grid electricity needs. According to ESCAP, 200 million people in the Asia Pacific region live without electricity and 1.2 billion people without access to clean cooking fuel. Joint efforts will focus on developing sustainable energy policies that are closely integrated with health and industrial development policies to bolster recovery efforts and rebuild economies. \n“The pandemic is an opportunity for us to rethink our economic growth path that has come at a heavy cost to the people and planet,” said Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana, United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP. “To bring about a fundamental shift for the energy transition, we need to adopt the motto of ‘no more business as usual’ for all stakeholders. Policymakers should not lose sight of the looming climate crisis, but rather design economic stimulus packages with social inclusion and environmental sustainability built into every decision in particular sustainable energy development.” \n“We are living in truly unprecedented times, calling for decisive and cooperative action among the international community to save lives and support livelihoods all over the world,” said IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera. “The Asia-Pacific region faces unique energy challenges that undermine the ability of governments to respond to this crisis and build economic resilience. Renewables can underpin these efforts and therefore can play an instrumental role in both the response and the recovery.” \nWith national budgets strained by immediate COVID-19 needs, short to medium-term energy access investment may represent less of a priority for governments. However, underinvestment in this area could severely impact the capacity of rural health centres to support front-line health workers and provide essential services to COVID-19 patients. When a vaccine does become available, the provision of cold storage and refrigerated transport across large areas will be critical. Decentralized renewable energy technologies such as solar will be key for large-scale immunization efforts in developing countries. Furthermore, slow progress in mainstreaming clean cooking solutions may expose millions of people to the dangerous combination of particulates and COVID-19. Scientists are already investigating links between air pollution and higher levels of coronavirus mortality, with preliminary results showing a probable correlation between the two. \nRenewables can be deployed rapidly and are therefore well-placed to support immediate crisis response efforts including electrification of public health value chains. In the medium to long-term, renewables-based energy systems can also be an engine of sustainable growth. Renewable energy costs in many parts of the world now outcompete traditional energy sources, presenting cost saving opportunities for governments and consumers while boosting energy security, building energy independence and supporting climate-related nationally determined contributions. \nAccording to IRENA’s recently launched Global Renewables Outlook report, renewables can supply more than half of all power needs in Southeast Asia alone by 2030, boosting the regional economy by more than 4.4 per cent and growing jobs by close to 50 per cent in the process. In a recent COVID-19 policy report for Asia and the Pacific, ESCAP identified renewable energy as one of the main sectors to include in stimulus packages. \nDuring the 10th IRENA Assembly last January, ESCAP and IRENA signed a Memorandum of Understanding to work together to increase the uptake of renewable energy in the Asia-Pacific region, support the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and contribute to the achievement of SDG7 by 2030. \n### \nAbout the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) IRENA is the lead intergovernmental agency for the energy transformation that supports countries in their transition to a sustainable energy future, and serves as the principal platform for international cooperation, a centre of excellence, and a repository of policy, technology, resource and financial knowledge on renewable energy. With 161 Members (160 States and the European Union) and 22 additional countries in the accession process and actively engaged, IRENA promotes the widespread adoption and sustainable use of all forms of renewable energy in the pursuit of sustainable development, energy access, energy security and low-carbon economic growth and prosperity. \nAbout the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) ESCAP serves as the United Nations’ regional hub promoting cooperation among countries to achieve inclusive and sustainable development. The largest regional intergovernmental platform with 53 Member States and 9 Associate Members, ESCAP has emerged as a strong regional think-tank offering countries sound analytical products that shed insight into the evolving economic, social and environmental dynamics of the region. The Commission’s strategic focus is to deliver on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which it does by reinforcing and deepening regional cooperation and integration to advance connectivity, financial cooperation and market integration. ESCAP’s research and analysis coupled with its policy advisory services, capacity building and technical assistance to governments aims to support countries’ sustainable and inclusive development ambitions. \nContact information: IRENA: Damian Brandy, Communication Officer, dbrandy@irena.org , +971 (0) 2 417 9016.

Most economies experienced contractions during the first four months of 2020 and millions of people are projected to fall into extreme poverty this year. The disruption to food systems and reduced access to healthcare and education systems will also have profound effects on the most vulnerable communities and people in the region. \n“We have reached a point of great risks and opportunities for this world. If we are to tackle the fragilities this crisis has exposed, then our recovery must break with the past. It must pursue equality, inclusion, sustainability and transformation. It must bring the fundamental calling of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to life,” said United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed in her opening remarks. She called on governments to put resilience and sustainability at the core of recovery investment packages as well as reorient economic models to generate green jobs and invest in chronically underfunded public services such as social protection and healthcare. \nUnited Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Ms. Armida Salsiah Alisjahbana urged countries to turn challenges arising from the global health crisis into opportunities by leveraging innovation to advance technology-based solutions. “Protecting people’s well-being must be at the core of policy responses. By ensuring a readiness on the part of institutions, policymaking must be able to manage trade-offs and complexity in responding to future crises to safeguard sustainable development gains,” added Ms. Alisjahbana. \n“Science, technology and innovation has been vital in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and addressing complex environmental issues. The time is right for ESCAP member States to consider a digital revolution by enhancing scientific collaboration in our region,” shared H.E. Mr. Don Pramudwinai, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Thailand. He added, “However, bringing about a digital revolution also requires us to bridge the digital divide. Accelerating implementation of the SDGs through technology must begin by giving ordinary people the tools to do so.” \nChair of the 7th APFSD, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary and Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to ESCAP H.E. Ms. Samantha K. Jayasuriya underscored the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships moving forward: “To achieve the 2030 Agenda and to deliver on the global Decade of Action, we need a strong, and well-coordinated response, both at country level, including with all institutions and all members of society, as well as from the multilateral cooperation framework.” \nCivil society representative Ms. Deki Yangzom of Y-PEER Bhutan further highlighted the need to address systemic barriers that impact the acceleration of the SDGs: “We urge governments and the UN to include the civil society as part of policy decision processes. We want our voices to be heard because we are not only the future – we are the now.” \nDelegates at the APFSD this year reviewed six key transformative entry points to accelerate progress towards the SDGs. They are: 1) human well-being and capabilities; 2) sustainable and just economies; 3) food systems and nutrition patterns; 4) enhancing power grid connectivity to achieve affordable and clean energy for all; 5) urban and peri-urban development; and 6) global environmental commons. \nOn the sidelines, ESCAP, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) jointly launched the latest edition of the Asia-Pacific SDG Partnership Report - Fast-Tracking the Sustainable Development Goals: Driving Asia-Pacific Transformations . The report highlights strategies to accelerate transformation and helps countries compare their speed of progress with others. It calls for clear direction, removing systemic barriers, investing in institutional and public readiness to change, and upgrading policymaking approaches to manage increasingly complex development challenges. \nOne of the report’s key findings is that higher income is not a silver bullet to address the challenges posed by SDGs and achieve accelerated progress along transformative pathways. Low-income and lower middle-income countries emerged as some of the fastest-moving countries in the region. \nSince 2014, the APFSD has provided a unique annual platform for countries in Asia and the Pacific to share perspectives, challenges and best practices as they progress toward implementing the SDGs. Outcomes from APFSD will provide input into the global discussions held at the HLPF in July this year. \nThe full Asia-Pacific SDG Partnership report can be accessed at: http://bit.ly/SDGPartnersAP \nFor more information on the 7th APFSD: https://www.unescap.org/apfsd/7/ \nFor media enquiries, please contact: Ms. Kavita Sukanandan, Public Information Officer Strategic Communications and Advocacy Section, ESCAP T: (66) 2 288 1869 / E: sukanandan@un.org \n"}
