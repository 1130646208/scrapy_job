Through the data import from the Office of origin’s national/regional trademarks database, the application is automatically pre-populated with the relevant information for a Madrid international application - from contact details to a full list of goods and services. Built-in features also include the automatic verification of the classification of the list of goods and services, as well as its translation. This reduces user effort while also lessening the risk of irregularities, thus making the process of filing an international application more efficient and accurate.Availability of all services online will make the Madrid System more user-friendly, bringing long term benefits to the users as well as the Offices.By integrating online filing options currently available in all member Offices concerned, the Madrid Application Assistant serves as a convenient gateway to navigate applicants to those services quickly.Furthermore, improved quality of application files generated by the Madrid Application Assistant will contribute to substantially reduce workload of examination for the Office of origin by minimizing irregularities.The Madrid Application Assistant is derived from Madrid e-Filing, the WIPO-powered online filing solution for Madrid Member IP Offices. This means it could easily be upgraded to the latter in order to support all examination work by Offices of origin from start to finish, including online verification and real-time communication of files to WIPO. IP Offices are encouraged to liaise with WIPO to discuss upgrading the Madrid Application Assistant to Madrid e-Filing in the Offices of origin.WIPO advises all users of the Madrid System to use the Madrid Application Assistant and online filing services offered by IP Offices. It is committed to providing more online services under the Madrid System for the benefit of the users as well as member IP Offices.The Madrid Application Assistant is an electronic version of the official MM2 form that is used to file an international application under the Madrid System.The assistant records all the information required to complete an international application in an intuitive and linear manner. Once completed, the international application will be made available in a PDF format ready for you to submit to the Office of origin for certification.Functionalities of the Madrid Application Assistant include:  "},

It has been specifically designed to improve CMOs’ international coverage and boost the earnings of creators and publishers who have their rights managed by those CMOs.This new CISAC-WIPO partnership follows an agreement signed earlier this year on metadata between WIPO and SUISA, the Swiss authors’ CMO and a CISAC member. Under that agreement, WIPO Connect user societies obtain access to the global system for identifying authors, composers and publishers - the IPI system - managed by SUISA on behalf of CISAC.  With this agreement and the new one now concluded with CISAC, WIPO Connect users will be able to share their domestic repertoires on the international information exchange systems operated by CISAC.  This will help to accurately identify internationally the repertoire of authors and composers who belong to societies using WIPO Connect, and allow them to be remunerated.“I welcome these agreements which will pave the way for Collective Management Organizations in all WIPO member states to participate in the global copyright infrastructure and remunerate authors and composers’ for their music that is played abroad,” said Mr. Gurry. He added that “WIPO and CISAC have a longstanding and fruitful cooperation and we share the mission of promoting the creative sector’s contribution to cultural, social and economic development. In today’s global digital content marketplace, providing CMOs in developing countries with an IT solution that is linked to industry databases and tools is essential in realizing this mission.”Mr. Oron said “We are very pleased to conclude this agreement with WIPO and help support societies in development around the world. WIPO connect has huge potential for societies who currently struggle to take part in our international information exchange systems. With this new tool and the agreement now concluded, WIPO is better placed to support these societies’ efforts to receive royalties from abroad and to provide better services to the creators and publishers they represent.”SUISA CEO Andreas Wegelin said “SUISA welcomes its agreement with WIPO, which will help identify and document more authors, composers and publishers, especially in developing countries. SUISA and WIPO are both providing training and assistance to music societies in Africa and other emerging markets and we hope that our agreement will contribute to effective and efficient solutions for our sister societies using WIPO Connect.”1 Collective Management Organizations (or CMOs) represent right holders. They also document works, performances and phonograms, license the use of that repertoire, collect fees on the right holders’ behalf and distribute the royalties to them.The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is the global forum for intellectual property policy, services, information and cooperation. A specialized agency of the United Nations, WIPO assists its 193 member states in developing a balanced international IP legal framework to meet society's evolving needs.

This content can range from trade secrets to scripts, musical scores and other creative works, to research results, large data sets, artificial intelligence algorithms, or any business record.All of these should be treated as intellectual assets and be independently and securely documented at every stage of development, regardless of whether they eventually become formal IP rights. WIPO PROOF provides an efficient tool for creating evidence of the existence of an asset's digital files at each specific point in time, helping mitigate the risk of future legal disputes, as well as laying a foundation for any eventual registration of a formal IP right.In a highly dynamic global economy where value is increasingly based on human activity enabled by digital technologies and big data, it is critical to be able to prove that you were in possession of your intellectual asset's digital files. WIPO PROOF helps innovators and creators better protect their digital outputs and represents a significant step in expanding WIPO’s suite of services that meet the demands of the digital economy.By creating a date- and time-stamped fingerprint of a digital file, WIPO PROOF provides a sort of digital notary service, offering a trusted, cost-effective and efficient service worldwide. WIPO PROOF joins WIPO's market-leading IP services for patents, trademarks, industrial designs, geographical indications and arbitration and mediation.WIPO PROOF is an easy-to-use global, online service that rapidly generates tamper-proof evidence proving that a digital file existed at a specific point in time, and that it has not been altered since that time. The service creates a WIPO PROOF token, a date- and time-stamped digital fingerprint of the file or data, which can be used as evidence in a legal dispute. WIPO PROOF tokens can be purchased one at a time for a modest fee, or in bundles of multiple tokens at reduced rates valid during a two year period.WIPO PROOF tokens can be used to establish prior existence, helping prevent misuse and misappropriation, and can be useful in safeguarding intellectual assets at every stage of development from concept to commercialization, whether or not they eventually become formal IP rights. WIPO PROOF complements WIPO's existing IP systems, providing another tool for the strategic global management of intellectual assets.WIPO PROOF's many applications include the following: For trade secret strategies, using WIPO PROOF to certify the existence of a file or data at a specific point in time is a type of concrete action that underscores its value and demonstrates that steps were taken to safeguard it. For creative works, the ability to prove their existence at the time of creation is fundamental to safeguarding them from potential misappropriation or infringement.  WIPO PROOF is also useful in managing valuable data sets such as scientific research data or data for training AI models, because the existence and possession of each iteration of a data set can be formally documented in a matter of seconds.Anyone can access WIPO PROOF’s secure online website to request a WIPO PROOF token for a specific digital file. WIPO does not read the file’s contents or store a copy of it. WIPO PROOF’s secure, one-way algorithm interacts locally with the requestor’s browser to create a unique digital fingerprint of the file. Additionally, anyone - even third parties - can validate WIPO PROOF tokens on the website by following a few easy steps.WIPO PROOF uses Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology to generate WIPO PROOF tokens. PKI technology is a well-established and reliable cryptographic technology that is one of the most internationally accepted and recognized digital certification methods. Additionally, WIPO PROOF has been designed and developed according to eIDAS standards which are among the most robust and stringent in the world. WIPO PROOF tokens deliver the highest level of certainty that the date and time on the token is exact and has not been tampered with.WIPO PROOF provides reliable and verifiable evidence in case of disputes and litigation over the existence and integrity of the digital file and its related IP rights.DownloadThe World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is the global forum for intellectual property policy, services, information and cooperation.

Over 2,000 people from 130 countries, including representatives of member states, academic, scientific and private organizations, followed the deliberations. More than 50 speakers from a diverse range of organizations spoke during the meeting, underlining the timeliness and magnitude of the discussion on IP and AI. The Conversation was chaired by Ambassador François Rivasseau, Permanent Representative of France to the United Nations and other International Organizations in Geneva.In closing the meeting, Mr. Gurry said that WIPO will continue to foster dialogue by publishing on its web site all written interventions received within two weeks following the meeting’s closure and hold a Third Session of the Conversation on AI and IP at a later date in 2020.The WIPO Secretariat will also begin working on outlining preliminary considerations stemming from the many questions raised by AI for IP policy for the consideration of member states and other stakeholders. During the proceedings, Mr. Gurry said the Secretariat would study a member state delegate’s suggestion to develop a priority list of questions on the IP-AI topic.“The engagement in this second session of the Conversation on IP and AI by such a large and diverse audience shows the wide understanding of the importance of dialogue on AI and IP to encourage the future of creativity and innovation, even amid the economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and a rapidly digitalizing world,” said Mr. Gurry. “Even as international attention is rightly focused on moving beyond the pandemic, it is wonderful that so many in the IP community have convened again to evaluate the eventual impacts of AI on policy related to intellectual property, which has grown over the years into a major driver of economic growth.”Mr. Gurry convened the First Session of the WIPO Conversation on IP and AI in September 2019, bringing together member states and other stakeholders in an open forum to discuss the impact of Al on IP policy.WIPO subsequently developed for public consultation a compendium of the most-pressing questions likely to face IP policy makers from the impact of Al on IP policy. The paper received more than 250 submissions and comments from a wide global audience.A Revised Issues Paper was published in May 2020 taking into account the comments and forming the basis of the Second Session of the Conversation held this week.AI is increasingly driving important developments in technology and business. It is being employed across a range of industries, from telecommunications to autonomous vehicles.Increasing stores of big data and advances in affordable high computing power are fueling AI’s growth. AI has a significant impact on the creation, production and distribution of economic and cultural goods and services. Since one of the main aims of the IP system is to stimulate innovation and creativity in the economic and cultural systems, AI intersects with IP in a number of ways.In January 2019, WIPO issued a study that surveyed the landscape of AI innovation.

A key question is how the economic fallout from the COVID-19 crisis will impact start-ups, venture capital, and other traditional sources of innovation financing. Many governments are setting up emergency relief packages to cushion the impact of the lockdown and face the looming recession. But the GII 2020 advises that further rounds of support must prioritize and then broaden support for innovation, particularly for smaller enterprises and start-ups that are facing hurdles in accessing rescue packages.“The rapid, worldwide spread of the coronavirus requires fresh thinking to ensure a shared victory over this quintessential global challenge,” says WIPO Director General Francis Gurry. “Even as we all grapple with the immediate human and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments need to ensure that rescue packages are future oriented and support the individuals, research institutes, companies and others with innovative and collaborative new ideas for the post-COVID era. Innovations equal solutions.”In its associated annual ranking of the world’s economies on innovation capacity and output, the GII shows year-on-year stability at the top, but a gradual eastward shift in the locus of innovation as a group of Asian economies – notably China, India, the Philippines and Viet Nam – have advanced considerably in the innovation ranking over the years.Switzerland, Sweden, U.S., U.K and Netherlands lead the innovation ranking, with a second Asian economy - the Republic of Korea - joining the top 10 for the first time (Singapore is number 8). The top 10 is dominated by high-income countries.The geography of innovation continues to shift, the GII 2020 shows. Over the years, India, China, the Philippines, and Viet Nam are the economies with the most significant progress in their GII innovation ranking over time. All four are now in the top 50.The top-performing economies in the GII are still almost exclusively from the high-income group, with China (14th) remaining the only middle-income economy in the GII top 30. Malaysia (33rd) follows.India (48th) and the Philippines (50th) make it to the top 50 for the first time. The Philippines achieves its best rank ever—in 2014, it ranked 100th. Heading the lower middle-income group, Viet Nam ranks 42nd for the second consecutive year— from 71st in 2014. Indonesia (85th) joins the top 10 of this group. Tanzania tops the low-income group (88th).  “As shown by China, India and Viet Nam, the persistent pursuit of innovation pays off over time,\" says Former Dean and Professor of Management at Cornell University Soumitra Dutta. “The GII has been used by governments of those countries and others around the world to improve their innovation performance.”“There are now genuine risks to international openness and collaboration on innovation. Faced with unprecedented challenges, whether sanitary, environmental, economic or social, the world needs to combine efforts and resources to ensure the continuous financing of innovation,” says INSEAD Executive Director for Global Indices Bruno Lanvin.“Identification of appropriate innovation and ensuring its translation to scalable business models for economic profitability, social capital or positive environmental outcomes are the keys to innovation financing. Innovation may be fostered by risk sharing soft loans or grant-in-aid financial support to the industry for ideation, conceptualization, proof of concept and pilot scale or prototype development stages. For the effectiveness of innovation financing, an enterprise may be adjudged and assessed with the innovation excellence indicator based on a structural innovation framework.”“Our societies now leverage the power of virtual universes to create sustainable paths for the future. Investments have become mainly intangible, in the form of data and knowledge. These new assets are the infrastructure of a new World: developing shared wealth, improving global health, dealing with ecological challenges. “Investing together” leads to a new public-private relationship. New measurements are required, like the Global Innovation Index. Virtual universes make the invisible become visible, to invest right in the age of experience.”“The way to make Brazil more innovative necessarily entails the adoption of a robust long-term policy focused on allocating funds to innovation as a priority and on joint efforts by industry, government and academia. The difficulties being faced not only by Brazil, but by nations at large to address the Covid-19 pandemic have made even clearer the need to invest more and better in innovation.”*Mauritius ranks 52nd this year. However, the 2020 rank for Mauritius has wide significant data variability as compared to last year. A mix of new data availability, data revisions at the source and performance effects explain Mauritius’ rank movements.The two economies in Northern America, the U.S. and Canada, rank in the top 20 in this year’s GII.The U.S. maintains its 3rd position this year, thanks to its strong performance across all GII areas. It is the first economy worldwide in the GII indicators that capure the quality of innovation, with its excellent universities and high-quality scientific publications. The U.S. hosts the largest number (25) of top science and technology clusters in the world, led by the San Jose-San Francisco cluster.Sixteen of the GII leaders in the top 25 are European countries, with seven of them ranking in the top 10.Switzerland remains the world’s leader in innovation for the 10th consecutive year. A consistent producer of high-quality innovation outcomes, it improves in patents and venture capital deals.A solid human capital and research system, coupled with a sophisticated market with innovative firms, put Sweden in the second spot for the second consecutive year.  Due to a combination of performance improvements and model changes, France is among the top 20 economies that saw the most impressive rank increase this year, taking the 12th position, its best GII rank since 2009. It ranks 5th in the new indicator global brand value and is in the top 10 in R&D-intensive global companies, quality of scientific publications, and research talent in business enterprises. France hosts five of the world top 100 science and technology clusters, with Paris ranking 10th this year.The two most innovative economies in this region – Singapore (8) and the Republic of Korea (10) – rank in the top 10. China retains its 14th position, after its rapid rise in recent years.China has established itself as an innovation leader, with high ranks in important metrics including patents, utility models, trademarks, industrial designs, and creative goods exports. It boasts 17 of the top science and technology clusters worldwide - with Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou and Beijing in the 2nd and 4th spots respectively.The Republic of Korea moves into the top 10 group of the GII for the first time. It improves its ranks in various indicators, including environmental performance, patent families, quality of scientific publications, and high-technology manufactures, while retaining top 3 positions in R&D expenditures, researchers, and PCT patents. Three of its clusters make it to the top 100, with Seoul ranking 3rd worldwide.In the region, Malaysia (33) and the Philippines (50) move up the ranking thanks to its first-class tertiary education system, sophisticated capital market, and a vibrant private sector. Malaysia excels in high-technology exports and creative goods exports. The Philippines enters the top 50 this year, with top 10 ranks in utility models, productivity growth, high-technology exports and imports, and ICT services exports.Central and Southern AsiaIndia (48) retains the highest rank in the region, followed by the Islamic Republic of Iran (67).Moving up four positions since last year, India becomes the third most innovative lower middle-income economy in the world, thanks to newly available indicators and improvements in various areas of the GII. It ranks in the top 15 in indicators such as ICT services exports, government online services, graduates in science and engineering, and R&D-intensive global companies. Thanks to universities such as the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay and Delhi and the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru, and its top scientific publications, India is the lower middle-income economy with the highest innovation quality.This year Uzbekistan (93) enters the GII rankings and ranks 4th in its region, assisted by better data coverage. It ranks in the top 10 worldwide in three indicators: graduates in science and engineering, ease of starting a business, and capital investment.Israel (13), Cyprus (29), and the United Arab Emirates (34) are the top three economies in this region.Israel is the world leader in several key indicators such as researchers, R&D expenditures, and university-industry research collaboration. Thanks to these investments, Israel remains a top innovation player, especially in ICT services exports.Saudi Arabia (66) and Jordan (81) are among the economies that saw a significant improvement in their ranking this year, due to a combination of performance improvements and model changes. Saudi Arabia takes the the 3rd place in ease of protecting minority investors and ranks 13th in the state of cluster development. Jordan improves in variables related to the quality of its credit market, and in particular in ease of getting credit, domestic credit to private sector, and venture capital deals.Chile (54) ranks first in the region, followed by Mexico (55) and Costa Rica (56).Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina host global R&D companies and are among the top 10 middle-income economies in the quality of innovation. Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil produce high levels of scientific and technical articles, with Brazil making an impact also in patents.The region performs well in the new indicator global brands value: Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina are all outperformers in this indicator, having many more valuable brands than their income levels would predict.Mauritius (52), South Africa (60), Kenya (86) and the United Republic of Tanzania (88) are leading this region.With high-quality institutions and a dynamic market, Mauritius is the 9th most innovative upper middle-income economy in the world. However, the 2020 rank for Mauritius has wide significant data variability as compared to last year. A mix of new data availability, data revisions at the source and performance effects explain Mauritius’ rank movements.A sophisticated internal market is also the strongest area of South Africa, ranking first in market capitalization and ninth in domestic credit to the private sector. Kenya is among the economies holding the record of being innovation achievers for ten consecutive years, thanks to top 5 rankings in indicators such as ease of getting credit and R&D expenditures financed by abroad.  Tanzania benefits from a relatively well interlinked innovation system and good international connectivity and ranks in the top 25 in cost of redundancy dismissal and gross capital investment.Rwanda (91) significantly improves its rankings this year, thanks partly by improved data coverage. It ranks in the top 15 in ease of getting credit, microfinance loans, and productivity growth.  The Global Innovation Index 2020 (GII), in its 13th edition this year, is co-published by Cornell University, INSEAD, and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO, a specialized agency of the United Nations).Published annually since 2007, the GII is now a leading benchmarking tool for business executives, policy makers and others seeking insight into the state of innovation around the world. Policymakers, business leaders and other stakeholders use the GII to evaluate progress on a continual basis.  The study benefits from the experience of its Knowledge Partners: Confederation of Indian Industry, Dassault Systèmes – The 3DEXPERIENCE Company, and the National Confederation of Industry (CNI)—Brazil, as well as of an Advisory Board of international experts.The core of the GII Report consists of a ranking of world economies’ innovation capabilities and results. Recognizing the key role of innovation as a driver of economic growth and prosperity, and the need for a broad  vision of innovation applicable to developed and emerging economies, the GII includes indicators that go beyond the traditional measures of innovation, such as the level of research and development.To support the global innovation debate, to guide polices and to highlight good practices, metrics are required to assess innovation and related policy performance. The GII creates an environment in which innovation factors are under continual evaluation, including the following features:The GII 2020 is calculated as the average of two sub-indices. The Innovation Input Sub-Index gauges elements of the national economy which embody innovative activities grouped in five pillars: (1) Institutions, (2) Human capital and research, (3) Infrastructure, (4) Market sophistication, and (5) Business sophistication. The Innovation Output Sub-Index captures actual evidence of innovation results, divided in two pillars: (6) Knowledge and technology outputs and (7) Creative outputs.The index is submitted to an independent statistical audit by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission.The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Dassault Systèmes – The 3DEXPERIENCE Company, and the National Confederation of Industry (CNI) – Brazil collaborate as Knowledge Partners in 2020.Knowledge Partners believe in the role of innovation in increasing the competitiveness of nations, enabling economic growth, driving societal changes and building the foundation of a country’s future.They are committed to producing a valuable and non-partisan resource.
