They are at the heart of our work on upholding the rights of children affected by humanitarian crises.The CCCs promote equality, transparency, responsibility and a results-oriented approach to enable predictable and timely collective humanitarian action. Initially developed in 1998, and revised in 2010 and again in 2020, the CCCs are grounded in global humanitarian norms and standards and set commitments and benchmarks against which UNICEF holds itself accountable for the coverage, quality and equity of its humanitarian action and advocacy.The CCCs are based on global standards and norms for humanitarian actionGuided by international humanitarian and human rights law, particularly the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and its Optional Protocols, the CCCs apply in all countries and territories, in all contexts, and to all children affected by humanitarian crisis. They also contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and include explicit strategies to link humanitarian and development action, strengthen local capacity and systems and build resilience at all stages of humanitarian action.UNICEF works in over 190 countries and territories to save children's lives, to defend their rights, and to help them fulfill their potential. To learn more about UNICEF’s Core Commitments to Children, please visit www.corecommitments.unicef.org where you can find translations, the CCC toolkit, FAQs and related humanitarian knowledge and learning resources. The CCCs were revised in 2020 to reflect the dramatic changes of the global humanitarian context in recent years. Humanitarian crises are increasingly protracted. Rising disregard for international humanitarian and human rights law and humanitarian principles characterizes conflicts, disproportionately affecting children and women. Population growth, urbanization, environmental degradation and climate change, large-scale migration, forced displacements, as well as public health emergencies increasingly compound the threats that children face. The CCCs have therefore been revised to equip UNICEF and its partners to deliver principled, timely, quality and child-centred humanitarian response and advocacy in any crises with humanitarian consequences.", "category": "Humanitarian Action and Emergencies"},

We see today technological advances that we could only dream about 25 years ago, especially in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) areas. Yet, despite progress, gender equality continues to be elusive. Some areas essential for the achievement of women’s empowerment, such as STEM, still lack women’s participation.This document seeks to call attention to the potential of STEM education to transform gender norms in the education system, to improve quality learning opportunities for girls, and to highlight key actions that can accelerate girls’ transition between education and technical expert jobs in STEM industries. Critically, STEM education also has the potential to contribute to personal empowerment, transformation of communities and nations, and building economies for the future.The evidence presented here provides a foundation for a call to action for global, national and regional actors. All stakeholders are called to work together to dismantle the barriers that girls face to develop the skills they need to become users, shapers and creators of scientific knowledge and new technologies. This will allow girls to choose the skills they want to learn and how to apply them, empowering them to contribute to a gender-equal world. Please contact: pubdoc@unicef.org", "category": "Education"},

It provides targeted recommendations to ensure continuity of learning while schools are closed, and to establish comprehensive, timely and evidence-based plans for reopening schools in a way that is safe, gender-responsive and child-friendly.\nPlease contact: pubdoc@unicef.org", "category": "Girls education"},
