So we are trying to also adopt somewhat of a programmatic approach, in terms of de-risking some of the risks that you mentioned, backstopping a lot of these risks. \nJS: Certain countries here in Asia are blessed to be on what's called the ring of fire. And because of the volcanic activity in those countries, they have what's called a geothermal resource, which is again an indigenous fuel resource. So, we've been very successful in Indonesia, where we've done three great geothermal projects and we're also again here in the Philippines, we supported two geothermal plants through a bond issue called Tiwi-MakBan. So, I'm really hopeful that we can do more geothermal projects in the future. \nWhat was the most amazing is I didn't realize and I don't know, again this is something that you may even consider, is that geothermal is typically viewed for power generation, but we discovered that there's a low-temperature geothermal resource in (People's Republic of) China. So, we were able to work with an Icelandic company to even develop district heating using geothermal power. \nSC: What kind of trends do you see going forward, Jackie, in the next let's say two to five years? \nJS: I'm glad you asked that Shan, because I think one of the challenges that we both face is these renewable energy projects are very small and we’re not focused only on project finance as a lending modality. \nSo, one of the things I think we both need to approach our clients with is more of a portfolio type approach. So we did this in Indonesia, for example, where we took a wind project of 72 megawatts and combined it with four smaller solar projects that the client was also developing at the same time, three at five megawatts and one at 20 megawatts, and put that together as a financing package, as more of a portfolio. And that combined with we're seeing trends where we're talking to clients to introduce them to things like green bonds, so going to the bond markets. \nWhat do you think? \n\"We expect the topography of the energy sector in many of these countries to dramatically change in the next five to 10 years.\" - Shantanu Chakraborty \nSC: Actually, just to take on your first point, Jackie, we also again in the more mature countries in my region - and India comes to my mind first - we have been adopting something similar to what you said, a portfolio type of approach because we have to talk at scale in those markets. The markets have matured, the markets have gone through various phases of de-risking and we have to talk at scale. So as you rightly said, we have supported, for instance, ReNew Power at an early growth stage through equity. \nIt also de-risks the portfolio because the money gets diversified across various discrete assets. That's one trend that we do wish to continue to follow in some of these countries. \nThe second trend I am seeing is a real attempt on the part of the frontier fossil fuel-dominated economies to actually go green. So a lot of action and the countries that come off the top of my head are really countries like Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, these are all very, very fossil fuel-rich countries, but they are making a very serious attempt at instituting a very robust regulatory and PPP framework, attracting investor interest. \nThe third trend really is a strong commitment again, as I mentioned earlier, to the NDCs and the Paris Agreement. We are seeing a lot of push in these areas and expect actually the topography of the energy sector in many of these countries to dramatically change in the next five to 10 years. \nJS: What we really should emphasize when we talk about renewable power compared to thermal power, is that really unlike thermal power you don't really have - your fuel source is essentially free, right?  It's the sun, it's the wind, it's water, but really your big cost is your financing cost. Blended finance is very important. \nSC: Because without that, I think it's very difficult for these new alternative sources of energy to penetrate into deeply entrenched fossil fuel-based energy mix countries. \nJS: I agree with you, we're very grateful to the Canadian Fund, the LEAP Fund  (Leading Asia’s Private Sector Infrastructure Fund). We've been using the Clean Technology Fund for a long time to ensure that some of these projects which are, as you rightfully said, the first of its kind in these countries and could not have happened. \nIt's a completely new legal and regulatory framework that some of these renewable energy projects have to enter into. They need our long-term financing from ADB, blended with a certain percentage of concessional finance to make these projects bankable. \nSC: So, I think we are doing our best in terms of supporting our member countries as they embark themselves upon a very robust renewable roadmap. \n"},
{"organization": "Asian Development Bank", "category": "articles", "crawlTime": "2020-10-30", "title": "Giving Hope to Young Filipinos through JobStart Philippines", "issueAgency": "ADB", "issueTime": "2 January 2020", "abstract": "A new ADB loan will help the Philippine government boost youth employment", "url": "https://www.adb.org/news/features/giving-hope-young-filipinos-through-jobstart-philippines", "detail": "A new ADB loan will help the Philippine government boost youth employment. \nJundelyn Baylosis Sato, 23, knows that life as a person with disability (PWD) is full of challenges, including the difficulty of finding a job due to discrimination. But a visit in August 2017 to her local government unit’s (LGU) Public Employment Service Office (PESO) in Kidapawan City in southern Philippines turned her life around. \nFrom being bullied as a child and with low self-esteem most of her teenage years because of fibrous dysplasia, a chronic disorder that causes abnormal bone growth including on the right side of her face, Sato transformed into a confident young teacher and mentor on technical and vocational courses after undergoing life skills and technical training courses through the JobStart Philippines Program. \nJobStart is a 5-year-old program of the Philippines' Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) aimed at enhancing the employability of Filipino youth through full-cycle employment facilitation services. It involves one-on-one career coaching, opportunities for technical skills training, and paid internships with private sector employers. \n“What I value the most with JobStart is they didn’t reject me despite my condition, but instead they helped me build my confidence. I even gained friends through JobStart,” said Sato, who struggled to find a job for more than a year after graduating in April 2016 from the University of Southern Mindanao with a Bachelor of Technical Teachers’ Education degree. \n“Now that I have a job, I am able to give money to my parents for our household expenses. I can also buy things that I want for myself and my four siblings,” she said. “JobStart was instrumental to what I am enjoying now.” \nIn 2011, the Philippine government, through the DOLE, requested assistance from Asian Development Bank (ADB) to explore innovative ways to improve government employment facilitation systems. Together, DOLE and ADB crafted interventions aimed at supporting policy development, regulatory reviews, and capacity development at PESOs, which act as the LGUs’ frontline for employment information and services. \nPart of ADB’s assistance then was to help design and implement the JobStart pilot project to assist the school-to-work transition of at-risk youths—those who are out of school, unemployed, and not getting any training. \nFrom four PESOs or LGUs implementing the JobStart pilot program in 2014, there are now 35 LGUs administering the program nationwide. ADB and the Government of Canada helped fund the pilot program. \n“Young people struggling to find jobs after they leave school is still a persistent problem in the Philippines. Our studies show it can take the average Filipino youth up to four years to find a wage job,” said ADB Country Director for the Philippines Mr. Kelly Bird. \n“Creating wage jobs for the youth is critical to helping reduce poverty and income inequality in the country. We are committed to continuing ADB’s strong partnership with DOLE in youth employment programs,” he said. \nIn 2016, the law institutionalizing the nationwide implementation of JobStart took effect, guaranteeing the sustainability of the program with regular government funding after a successful pilot. \nMore than 200 employers have so far partnered with the government under the JobStart program, benefiting more than 20,000 out-of-school youths, about three-fifths of whom women and more than two-thirds coming from low-income households. \nOn 3 December 2019, ADB approved a $400 million loan for the second subprogram of the policy-based Facilitating Youth School-to-Work Transition Program. The new loan will support DOLE’s Jobstart program, as well as other employment schemes and labor policy reforms aimed to ensure that young Filipinos have access to job opportunities. \nWith ADB’s support, nearly 40% of the 1,253 PESO centers nationwide are fully institutionalized, while more than two-thirds have received skills development from DOLE, ensuring that PESO officers are equipped with the right skills to mentor Filipino youth on how to successfully find jobs. \nIn Sato’s case, the Facebook account of the Kidapawan City PESO center was her link to JobStart. She visited the center after seeing PESO’s announcement on pre-employment programs on Facebook. The officers at the center introduced the JobStart program to her and encouraged her to apply. \nAfter finishing the 10-day life skills training and the 40-day technical training on hairdressing at the Kidapawan Technical School (KTS) in May 2018, she was asked by the same school to apply as a teacher. She now teaches about 250 students in junior and senior high school in KTS, and volunteers as technical–vocational mentor to out-of-school youths during her free time. \n“It is a great blessing that there is a JobStart program to give hope to the youth, those who graduated from school but unemployed,” she said. “Even if you don’t have financial resources, you can still undergo training under JobStart.” \n"},

The new, climate-proofed port will be central to meeting the Nauruan people’s needs for fuel, food, and medical supplies and will improve the country’s maritime trade and connectivity, and will promote economic recovery. It’s also presenting a vital opportunity for workers here to improve and update their skills and knowledge. \nI have worked at the Aiwo Boat Harbour for almost 16 years. I repair and maintain vehicles and equipment around the site. I like working with my hands. \nAll of us here will be given training in everything to operate the new port. Formal training in maritime safety, stevedoring, cargo-handling and maintenance and accounting begins in a couple of months, but we have already received training in welding and electrical work. I am looking forward to the new training as I’m sure it will help me do my job better. It’s important to learn new things. When you work here at the port you need to have multiple skills and by strengthening the skills of the workers, the Nauru Port Authority will also be strengthened. \nThe old port is about 100 years old and was falling apart. It is very rundown. The loading and unloading of cargo from container vessels and fuel from tankers has become very dangerous and sometimes life-threatening. Our work here is challenging, and we work hard. \nWe have dreamed of this new port for so many years. Conditions for workers at the new port will be safer and equipment will be updated. I think our work will become easier and more enjoyable and we’ll feel more supported by the government. Hopefully, my children can work there in the future. \nThe new port will be like a lifeline for the people of Nauru. It will let us get our food and other supplies from overseas quicker, will help create jobs, and the new port will be safer for the port workers, especially when the weather is bad \n"},

Water levels in the Mekong River fluctuate during the rainy and dry seasons, causing extensive flooding or drought in nearby districts and communities. This threatens agricultural productivity, economic activity, and the livelihoods of the more than 60,000 people living in the area. \nWith the changes in the season affecting her family’s livelihoods, Ferchanthala said they sometimes do not have enough to eat as floods destroy crops and submerge houses, roads, and other agricultural infrastructure. \nThe government is working to help communities address these challenges through the Greater Mekong Subregion Flood and Drought Risk Management and Mitigation Project, which is partly financed by a $36.5 million loan and grant from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nADB’s assistance, which was approved in 2012, has supported the design and implementation of measures to help farmers like Ferchanthala better manage floods and droughts in the provinces of Khammouan and Savannakhet, as well as in Vientiane. \n“This is a long-awaited project for the people in the southern Vientiane capital region, which brings a set of preparedness measures, along with community participation, to improve flood and drought risk management and reduce their vulnerability to floods,” said Soukaseum Dalasene, the Project Director of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport’s Department of Waterways. \nThe project has built a 32.2-kilometer flood embankment-cum-road in the Hatxaifong District and installed seven water control gates. These structures have helped protect 20,000 hectares of agricultural land and surrounding communities from flooding. \nMore importantly, the project has helped stabilize the farming economy by constructing concrete canal systems as part of pump irrigation schemes. This system now provides more than 2,000 people in Xaythany District, where Ferchanthala lives, with enough water for agricultural production in the dry season while protecting them from floods in the rainy season. \nThe project also trained farmers on how to manage the entire agriculture process through Water User Groups, demonstration gardens, and techniques on increasing food crop yields. \n“Reducing risks and poverty caused by floods and droughts in the Lower Mekong Basin, particularly in the Lao PDR, is about building infrastructure that is resilient to disasters and equipping affected communities with skills to plan, predict, and prepare for climate change,” said Yasushi Negishi, ADB’s Country Director for Lao PDR. \nSysavanh Xorsathit, a villager in Xaythany District, said people in his community are “very proud” to have learned how to plant and grow crops, access markets, and manage water use. Farmers used to grow only one crop a year, but now they can plant two crops a year, including melons and cantaloupes, and sell them at nearby markets. \n“There used to be no planting in the dry season, but now planting is done throughout the year,” said Xorsathit. \nMore than 35% of the project’s beneficiaries are women, who are earning more money and improving the quality of their families’ lives. \n“I am enjoying my livelihood now without worrying about the flash floods like in the past, and I can secure food and income for my family and support my kids for their education,” said Ferchanthala. \n"},

To better understand how ADB’s developing member countries (DMCs) are weathering the crisis, ADB's Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD) launched the ADB COVID-19 Policy Database . The database contains information on the measures that all 68 ADB members have implemented to combat the pandemic. \nWe have classified the measures taken by governments using two lenses. First is through the operational lens, which tracks how a given measure “works” its way through the financial system into the economy. A measure can “work” as any of three possible ways, which are liquidity support, credit support, or income support. \nSecond is through the lens of financial statement effects, that is, whether or not the measure creates more debt or more income, for example, net worth or equity, ceteris paribus, for the recipients. \nThe combination of the two dimensions results in five types of government measures: (1) actions to support normal functioning of money markets; (2) encouraging private credit creation; (3) direct long-term lending to households, businesses, and local governments; (4) equity claims on the private sector; and (5) direct support to income or revenue of households, businesses, and local governments. \nWe have three additional measures that effectively double count from an accounting perspective. These are: (6) reallocating previously budgeted spending; (7) central bank purchases of national government bonds or direct lending to government; and (8) international assistance. \nThe very rich information we have gathered up until 20 April already permits a good understanding of what ADB’s 48 DMCs have so far done. Several interesting points stand out: \nThe total estimated amount of the packages to combat COVID-19 by ADB’s DMCs is $1.8 trillion. The regional distribution is as follows: 80.9% East Asia; 13.1% Southeast Asia; 4.2% South Asia; 1.7% Central and West Asia; and 0.1% Pacific. Nine out of the 46 DMCs have so far provided no specific amounts, though some of them have non-monetary packages. These are the Federated States of Micronesia, Georgia, Kiribati, Nepal, Niue, Solomon Islands, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \nThe People’s Republic of China (PRC) has provided the largest package—$1.3 trillion— followed by the Republic of Korea at $109 billion, and Thailand at $70 billion. As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), the largest packages are those of Kazakhstan, Thailand, and Singapore slightly above 10%. The largest package per capita is that of Singapore at $7,500. On the other hand, the smallest packages (also as a percentage of GDP), are from countries in the Pacific, Myanmar, and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. In per capita terms, these nations’ packages are also small, as well as those of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, which are all below $100. \n43.42% of the DMCs’ $1.8 trillion package was dedicated to direct income support (measure 5). This is followed by support to the normal functioning of money markets (measure 1), with 16.83% allocation. About 30% of the total had no clear assignment to a specific measure. Direct income support is also the largest measure in all five ADB regions. In the case of Central and West Asia, the percentage is as high as 80.5% of the region’s package. \nThe DMCs’ total package represents 7.81% of their combined GDP. By region, this share is 6.3% of East Asia’s combined GDP; 1% of Southeast Asia’s; 0.3% of South Asia’s; 0.1% of Central and West Asia’s; and 0.01% of the Pacific’s. Direct income support represents 3.39% of their combined GDP. These two shares are much higher for ADB’s non-DMC members: the total package represents 27.71% of these nations’ combined GDP, and direct income represents 8.08% of their GDP. This means that DMCs are using fiscal measures much less than the non-DMCs (3.39% vs. 8.08%). \nCheck out the full database . \nLearn more about key findings . \nThe liabilities of numerous central banks are “funding” government deficits (measure 7) in different forms. For example, the central banks of the Philippines, the United Kingdom (UK), and Indonesia have engaged in direct central bank lending/primary market purchases, while those of the United States, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, Canada, Sweden, and the UK, implemented quantitative easing. Japan and Australia have set explicit bond rate targets or aimed at controlling the yield curve; while India has sold bills and bought bonds. \nPreliminary analysis indicates that both the package per capita and the package as a percentage of GDP are statistically unrelated to the number of COVID-19 cases and the number of deaths. Package per capita and the package as a percentage of GDP are likewise unrelated to the difference in growth forecast for 2020 between the before-the-crisis figures and the April figures. Both variables are, however, statistically related to income per capita: a 1% increase in GDP per capita leads to a 1.5% increase in the package per capita; and to a 0.5% increase in the share of package in GDP. Rich countries are spending disproportionately more. \nMoving forward, our analysis and reflection of what countries have done lead us to think that there are five key areas for DMCs’ policymakers to consider for the medium and long-term recovery: (1) building resilience to the next crisis; (2) thinking seriously about the future: the country’s development and growth model; (3) having courage to design an active fiscal policy strategy; and (4) not thinking that central banks are independent institutions with enough information to run the economy. \nDevelopment of the database was led by Jesus Felipe, Advisor; Gemma Estrada, Economics Officer; Susan Torres, Publications Officer; and Mary Ann Magadia, Associate Operations Analyst. The objective is to enhance the effectiveness of ADB’s assistance and to identity policy options for economic recovery. \n"},

Residents instead burn solid fuel, mainly raw coal and waste, for heat and cooking. \nThe country’s energy system is the most heavily dependent on coal among the developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In 2018, coal-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plants constituted 93% of total power generation in the country’s Central Energy System (CES), which accommodate more than 80% of the domestic demand. \nThis has created severe air pollution in the country, with all the accompanying health problems. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), annual mean particulate matter of less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) in Ulaanbaatar is 6–10 times higher than the recommended safe levels of the WHO air quality guidelines. The pollution levels are worse during winter months, when the temperature can go below minus 40 degree Celsius. \nThe energy sector is Mongolia’s largest contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accounting for about two thirds of the country’s GHG emissions. According to Mongolia’s nationally determined contributions, GHG emissions will increase to 51.5 million tons of carbon dioxide (mtCO 2 ) by 2030 in the business-as-usual scenario, with energy’s share of total emissions increasing to 81.5%. The country targets reducing GHG emissions by 7.3 mtCO 2 by 2030 through emission reductions from power generation (4.9 mtCO 2 ), industry (0.7 mtCO 2 ), and transportation (1.7 mtCO 2 ). \nBecause of the climate change impact, financial resources are less available for coal-fired CHP development/expansion projects. The delayed investment in new generation capacity combined with growing electricity demand have raised the utilization of aging CHP plants during peak energy demand hours in winter, exceeding 90%. The energy supply shortage during winter peak hours is an urgent challenge facing the country. \nMongolia is among the most heavily coal dependent developing member countries of ADB, and its energy sector is the largest contributor to its greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for about two thirds of the total,” says Director General of ADB’s East Asia Department (EARD) James Lynch. “To decarbonize Mongolia’s energy sector, the government aims to increase the country’s share of renewable energy, especially wind and solar, which hold great potential for Mongolia.” \n\"To decarbonize Mongolia’s energy sector, the government aims to increase the country’s share of renewable energy, especially wind and solar, which hold great potential for Mongolia.\" \nThe country’s combined wind and solar power potential is estimated to be equivalent to 2,600 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity or 5,457 terawatt-hours of clean electricity generation per year. The amount is enough to meet the country’s energy demand (around 1.2GW as of 2018), and can meet northeast Asia’s regional energy demand with a suitable transmission infrastructure. The government’s target is a share of renewable energy in total installed capacity of 20% by 2023 and 30% by 2030 as announced in the State Policy on Energy, 2015–2030. \n“The country’s rich renewable energy resources have not been fully utilized yet for various reasons,” says Director of ADB's Sustainable Infrastructure Division in the East Asia Department Sujata Gupta. “One of the challenges is the variability of renewable energy generation and the lack of regulation reserve—or flexible generation. Because the renewable energy output fluctuates subject to weather, the regulation reserve—usually contributed by the other power plants—needs to constantly fill the gap between the renewable energy outputs and demand.” \nFurther, even if a sufficient amount of regulation reserve is available, the country’s energy market lacks the system to provide regulation or ancillary service in an efficient manner. For those reasons, renewable energy plants’ output is curtailed during off-peak hours. This has made the country’s renewable energy investment less attractive for the private sector. \nRecognizing the challenges, the Government of Mongolia requested ADB to support the installation of a battery energy storage system (BESS) in the country. The country’s first utility-scale advanced BESS with a capacity of 125 MW/160 MWh is being financed by an ADB loan of $100 million and grant of $3 million from the High-Level Technology Fund approved in April 2020. \n\"One of the challenges [in Mongolia] is the variability of renewable energy generation and the lack of regulation reserve. Because the renewable energy output fluctuates subject to weather, the regulation reserve—usually contributed by the other power plants—needs to constantly fill the gap between the renewable energy outputs and demand\". \n“Since the project BESS plant will be larger than the current world’s largest BESS in operation in Hornsdale, Australia, it will provide a blueprint for others to follow in the development and operation of large-scale BESS to decarbonize power systems in other DMCs,” says ADB Senior Energy Specialist and Project Team Leader Atsumasa Sakai. \nThe BESS plant will be owned and operated by the national transmission company, the National Power Transmission Grid, as a smart grid to strengthen the power supply reliability in the CES.The project expects to help transform the energy sector in the following ways: \nDecarbonizing the energy sector. The project BESS plant would supply clean peaking power that is charged by renewable energy electricity and provide regulation reserve to integrate additional renewable energy capacity in the transmission grid. On successful completion in 2024 the project will supply 44 gigawatt-hours of clean peaking power annually, and support the integration of an additional 859 gigawatt-hours of renewable electricity into the CES grid annually. This will mean 842,039 tons of CO 2 emissions less per year by 2025. \nStrengthening the energy supply reliability. As a backup power plant in case of possible power failure, the project BESS plant will save the country from possible electricity/heat supply outages in winter. \nSupporting private sector investment in renewable energy. The project is assisting the government to prepare market design and guidelines for ancillary service, utilizing regulation reserves provided by third parties. “This would help the country’s energy market transit from the current regulated operation to a more market-oriented operation, improving the sector efficiency,” says ADB Principal Energy Specialist Shigeru Yamamura. “Once completed, ancillary service with private sector owned battery plants would be possible, accelerating renewable energy development, and boosting reliability.” \nADB has also supported the government to improve energy sector efficiency with a separate technical assistance on smart energy systems, which covers automatic generation control and streamlined power settlement procedures, since December 2019. \n“The transformation is coming soon,” says ADB Country Director in Mongolia Pavit Ramachandran. “Upon project completion, Mongolia’s energy sector as well as people’s lives will change. This will put on track the decarbonization of the energy sector and help unlock renewable energy potential to bring back blue skies to Mongolia’s urban areas.” \n"},

Now, more than ever before, the long-term development partners are committed to working together to help create an even more inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia Pacific region. \nAustralia has been, and is, a key partner of ADB. It is a founding member of ADB and the fifth largest shareholder. Since 1990, Australia has provided $172.6 million for 12 trust funds in Asia and the Pacific, helping to support clean energy, health, transport, education, business investment, and gender equality. \nFrom 2018 to 2019, Australia provided $126.3 million for grants and technical assistance and contributed $16 million to two trust funds in the region. \nTo date, Australia has contributed about $2.8 billion to the Asian Development Fund (which provided concessional lending in addition to grant operations until the merger for concessional lending with ADB’s ordinary capital resources in 2017), making it the third-largest donor after Japan and the United States. \nThe Asian Development Fund, through initiatives to support small island developing states and countries vulnerable to natural disasters, particularly benefits the Pacific region. \nAustralia is a strong partner of ADB in the Pacific and is encouraging and facilitating ADB’s expanded presence in the region. This has seen ADB’s portfolio double every five years since 2005. At the end of 2019, ADB’s Pacific portfolio stood at $3.2 billion for 77 projects. \nIn 2019 alone, ADB committed $510 million in loan and grant financing to the Pacific from its own resources, and $221 million in co-financing, for 27 projects. To boost ADB’s field presence to facilitate aid coordination and aid effectiveness in the Pacific region ADB is opening offices in 13 of its 14 Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs), including in Palau where a new office was opened last week . \n“Australia’s support of ADB’s expanding presence in the Pacific region is highly appreciated,” said Ms. Lotte Schou-Zibell, Regional Director of ADB’s Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office in Sydney. “The Australia-ADB partnership has been validated by Pacific governments, who return to ADB as their partner of choice and recognize Australia’s often leading role in making our support possible.” \nCofinancing with Australia has helped ADB build local capacities in the Pacific region by supporting donor coordination, portfolio management, and policy dialogue. \nThe objectives of Australia’s support for the Indo-Pacific region (Which extends from the eastern Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean connected by Southeast Asia, including India, North Asia and the United States) parallel those of ADB: to promote prosperity, reduce poverty, and enhance stability. In 2016, ADB and Australia reaffirmed their shared strategic priorities and commitment to keep working toward them through their 2016-2020 Partnership Framework on Development , which articulated their strategy to help alleviate poverty and improve living standards in the Indo-Pacific. The framework specified ADB and Australia’s shared objectives of promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth; facilitating trade and investment, promoting international competitiveness, and supporting private sector growth and investment; and building public awareness of outcomes of the Australia-ADB partnership. \nAlongside its broad contribution to ADB, Australia also partners with the bank on a wide range of initiatives in the Pacific. The Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI) was established in 2007 to help Pacific countries boost their business sectors and thereby promote inclusive economic growth. With more than 80% of its funding coming from Australia, PSDI has implemented more than 300 reforms that have made it easier for people in the Pacific to start and grow their businesses. These include laws and online registries that increase access to finance by making it easier for banks to accept movable property as collateral; online business registries that dramatically reduce the time and cost of formalizing a business; state-owned enterprise reforms that have doubled the profits of government businesses while delivering better, cheaper services and reducing market distortions; new competition policies, laws, and agencies that level the playing field and protect consumers; and integrated—as well as specific—actions to economically empower women. Australia recently committed another $14 million to continue PSDI through to 2024. \n“Australia’s support of ADB’s expanding presence in the Pacific region is highly appreciated. The Australia-ADB partnership has been validated by Pacific governments, who return to ADB as their partner of choice and recognize Australia’s often leading role in making our support possible.” \nThe outcomes of PSDI-backed reforms are particularly evident in Papua New Guinea (PNG), where an integrated program of support made possible by additional Australian financing is reshaping the economy’s capacity to provide for the people of PNG, as well as opportunities for them to participate in the economy. \nOther Australian co-financed projects in PNG are also having a big impact. The Rural Primary Health Services Delivery Project is upgrading rural health facilities and has established 27 community health posts in eight provinces and a digital public health data collection and information system. New facilities in Bulolo District Hospital and Mutzing Health Centre in Markham District, for example, helped deliver 802 births, facilitate 1,145 medical admissions, and service 114,800 general outpatient cases in 2019 alone. Meanwhile, the Sustainable Highlands Highway Investment Program is helping implement the government’s objective to rehabilitate, upgrade, and maintain 430 kilometers of the Highlands Highway. \nIn Tonga, since 2011, the Nuku’alofa Urban Development Sector Project, cofinanced by ADB and the governments of Australia and Tonga, has been delivering projects to improve living conditions and increase access to Nuku’alofa’s municipal services. This has included: the upgrading of water and sanitation services to provide efficient, sustainable, and disaster-resilient water supply and sewerage to the capital’s residents. Meanwhile, a Renewable Energy Project co-financed by Australia, ADB, and the Green Climate Fund is helping Tonga transition to renewable energy and provide energy security and access to people in the outer islands . The project is establishing new renewable energy plants, battery storage, and mini grids; promoting private sector investment; and building capacity to operate and maintain energy assets. \nADB and Australia continue to build an enduring partnership that is strong, effective, and transparent, and continues to evolve in response to the critical needs and opportunities in the region. Collectively, ADB and Australia’s scale of operations, technical expertise, experience, and partnerships allow the Asia Pacific region to better respond to development challenges and foster economic growth. \nFor inquiries, please contact Neil Hickey (link sends e-mail) (Communications Specialist, ADB's Department of Communications) and Sally Shute-Trembath (link sends e-mail) (Senior External Relations Officer, ADB's Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office in Sydney, Australia). \n"},

The economy, with its dependence on mining, which accounts for almost a quarter of gross domestic product and 90% of exports, remains vulnerable to swings in commodity prices. Mongolia is also highly dependent on trade with its neighbor, the People’s Republic of China, where the economic slowdown has triggered a sharp fall in export prices in Mongolia and badly hit transport, tourism, retail trade, and services. These combined to hit Mongolia with a 10.7% contraction in GDP in the first quarter of 2020. \nThe government launched on 27 March 2020 a countercyclical development expenditure program (CDEP) introducing $1.8 billion in measures to counter the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. CDEP contains cash transfer schemes and other social protection measures targeting poor and vulnerable groups, households, and businesses. For this, the government turned to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for assistance. \nADB responded on 12 May with the approval of a $100 million Countercyclical Support Facility Loan , funded through the COVID-19 pandemic response option (CPRO) under ADB’s Countercyclical Support Facility. \n“We received the official request for assistance from Mongolia on 17 April and delivered the package a little more than four weeks later,” said ADB Country Director in Mongolia Pavit Ramachandran. “This is something that would not have come together without the seamless coordination from across our team and ADB.” \nBut internal discussion on a response package for Mongolia started well before the ADB corporate COVID-19 package was approved. \n“ADB took unprecedented steps to put in place resources, policies, and business processes within a short span of time to respond to COVID-19 in Mongolia,” said Director for Public Management, Financial Sector and Regional Cooperation in the ADB East Asia Department Emma Fan. \n\"ADB took unprecedented steps to put in place resources, policies, and business processes within a short span of time to respond to COVID-19 in Mongolia\" \nStaff found that ADB’s close relationship with the government helped speed things along. “The government was able to move its machinery extremely quickly to get key information and to turn that around in just a couple of days,” said ADB Senior Country Economist in Mongolia Declan Magee. “That comes not from a year or two of engagement but from 30 years of consistent partnership—that is such an asset for ADB in Mongolia.” \nUnder the Countercyclical support the CDEP has increased the allocation under the Child Money Program. Private sector workers are exempt from personal income tax for 6 months starting from 1 April, aimed at employees at risk of losing their jobs. At least 45% of the beneficiaries are women. Support has also been provided to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises, including those engaged in international trade, particularly the import of critical food and medical supplies, to protect jobs. \n“Integrating gender into a budget support operation of this nature is a first and it does create a precedent,” said ADB Social Development Specialist Veronica Mendizabal Joffre. “We were 100% clear on the importance of this operation for women and Mongolian people in general and the strong teamwork gave us a push to continue and deliver.” \nEven with its stringent measures, the government estimates that 20% of the population are still at risk from the public health threat posed by COVID-19, particularly the poor and vulnerable. More than 10,500 Mongolians from overseas are waiting to return home from infected countries, potentially bringing the disease with them. But testing capacity for COVID-19 was inadequate and there is a lack of essential health care equipment and trained medical personnel. \nAmong ADB’s first corporate responses on COVID-19 was to reprogram $1.4 million of savings of the ongoing Fifth Health Sector Development Project in Mongolia as early as 13 February. A $1 million grant was subsequently allocated on 25 March from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund. This assistance was used to hand over in February and March 570 pieces of medical equipment for diagnosis and treatment patients with respiratory conditions for 30 district and provincial general hospitals and 4 tertiary level hospitals. The equipment included portable digital X-rays, ventilators, patient monitors, oxygen concentrators, infusion and injection pumps and nebulizers Personal protective equipment was also delivered to 700 customs officers working at the borders. \n\"The government was able to move its machinery extremely quickly to get key information and to turn that around in just a couple of days. That comes not from a year or two of engagement but from 30 years of consistent partnership—that is such an asset for ADB in Mongolia\" \nA small-scale technical assistance of $225,000 on 2 March 2020 has been strengthening national capacity for emergency preparedness. Under this, World Health Organization technical experts from Germany were deployed in March to train national experts in infection prevention and control as well as conduct training in provincial and district level hospitals. \nOn 7 May, ADB also approved $30 million in extra financing for the Fifth Health Sector Project to further strengthen the country’s preparedness and response. \nCPRO is providing further medical equipment and supplies, complementing this with a set of medium-term measures. These include strengthening 35 hospitals to meet national infection prevention and control standards, and improving 210 hospitals to meet national standards to manage severe respiratory infection patients, and enhancing testing capacity. \nThe assistance does not stop there. As part of ADB’s COVID-19 response package, a $26.4 million Shock Responsive Social Protection Project was approved on 19 June. The project will provide cash transfers to households channeled through the Food Stamp and Child Money Programs in Mongolia. ADB is also planning ahead to be ready to support a secondary response later this year should this be requested by a new government that will be formed after elections on 24 June in Mongolia. \n"},

Most formal financial institutions view them as high risk and high cost, as the transactions are often small and the clients in hard-to-reach locations. \nMicrofinance can break down these barriers. It helps low-income households to stabilize their income flows and save for future needs. In good times, microfinance helps families and small businesses to prosper, and at times of crisis it can help them cope and rebuild. \nHere are six ways ADB is using the power of microfinance to level the financial playing field for poor communities across the region: \nMicrofinance institutions (MFIs) across Asia and the Pacific struggle to get commercial funding to provide financial services to their borrowers. ADB partners with international and domestic financial institutions to support MFIs. ADB’s Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee Program facilitates local currency lending to the microfinance sector. Since 2010 the program has assisted 35 MFIs that have provided microfinance services to over six million borrowers in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia and Myanmar. As a part of ADB’s COVID-19 pandemic relief and recovery response, the program’s size has been increased to help support microfinance in difficult conditions. Source: Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee Program , ADB Triples COVID-19 Response Package to $20 Billion \nMany micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) are women-led and owned, so providing them with better financial options will improve women’s livelihoods and incomes. In Pakistan, MSMEs account for more than 90% of all enterprises. ADB partners with one of the country’s leading microfinance service providers to expand its lending operations, especially for women borrowers. The assistance will give Pakistani women and women-led MSMEs access to much-needed long-term financing to develop their livelihoods and incomes. Source: Expanding Access to Credit for Women \nMicrofinance services are helping rural women gain financial independence and empowering them to make good decisions. In the People’s Republic of China (PRC), around 45% of the rural population lacks credit access, especially women who usually have neither physical collateral nor the education needed to organize their finances. ADB’s partnership with CD Finance Management (previously called CFPA Microfinance Management) provides microcredit to poor rural households, targeting at least 121,000 women borrowers and includes measures to improve their financial planning skills and literacy. Source: Microfinance in Poverty-Stricken Counties (People’s Republic of China) \nWomen are often the most severely affected when communities are disrupted by armed conflict and by persistent regional economic disparities. In parts of Visayas and Mindanao, the central and southern regions of the Philippines, decades of lagging economic growth and conflict have hampered development and lowered income levels to below the national average. ADB is financing one of the country’s largest microfinance providers, ASA Foundation Philippines Inc., that focuses on women owners of micro-enterprises in these challenging regions to enhance their access to finance and build their economic base. Through this project, women are getting better access to credit, allowing them to improve their living conditions and help rebuild their communities. The financing was released during the COVID-19 pandemic, bolstering ASA’s resources at a critical period for on-lending to women suffering severe economic distress in these fragile regions.

Still MSMEs account for 90% of the country’s registered businesses and generate half of all jobs. To help these businesses expand, ADB is providing XacBank, Mongolia’s market leader in MSME financing, with long-term stable financial support. More financing helps to create growth opportunities for business and new jobs, supporting efforts to diversify Mongolia’s economy beyond mining.

A telling impact is the shortage in many countries of life-saving medical equipment such as ventilators. As countries entered lockdowns to contain the virus, healthcare authorities and governments were left scrambling to find the products they needed. \nThose efforts have been hampered by a lack of readily accessible information on supply chains for these crucial products. ADB’s Trade Finance Program and Supply Chain Finance Program is helping resolve this through a new online tool which maps these supply chains , allowing governments, banks, investors, and healthcare professionals to pinpoint companies making these products and intervene to clear any blockages. \n“This way, a fault somewhere along the supply chain can be fixed,” said ADB’s Head of Trade and Supply Chain Finance Steven Beck. “Banks or investors can fund a company struggling to meet increased demand.” \nIn the early days of the virus as health systems, governments, and international organizations realized they needed to start ramping up their stocks of goods like portable ventilators, it soon became clear that a key obstacle was a lack of clear understanding of who made what in the supply chains for those products. \nEven the banks didn’t have a full picture of whether the companies they worked with were involved in the supply lines. \n“That kind of information wasn’t available in a way that would make it easy for someone to address problems that might arise,” said Beck. “We decided to see if that was something we could do.” \nThe solution was an interactive mapping tool for the supply chains of products vital to healthcare workers and others on the frontlines of the battle. The tool, launched in May, enables governments, banks, investors, and healthcare professionals to trace the companies that make every component in products such as portable ventilators, down to the metal and rubber that goes into each part. \nAs well as ventilators, the mapping tool includes the entire supply chains for N95 respirators, face shields, goggles, aprons, surgical masks, and gowns. Previously, the information on who makes which part for which product was available in piecemeal fashion. But this information had never been brought together in one database that would allow a quick search. \n“When we heard about the issues with the supply chains, we started asking our bank partners which companies in their portfolios were involved in the supply chains for these products,” said Beck. “The idea was that we could help shine a spotlight on these supply chains and get help to where it was needed.” \nADB’s trade and supply chain finance businesses are uniquely placed to address the economic and financial impacts of the pandemic, as they are in constant contact with banks and other stakeholders involved in global trade. ADB’s COVID-19 response includes direct support for trade through an $800 million increase in the trade finance lending limit to $2.15 billion. \nBy mobilizing private sector cofinancing and turning short-dated trade transactions over quickly—the average trade finance transaction is only 142 days—the $2.15 billion limit is expected to support over $5 billion in trade during 2020.  A further $200 million of supply chain assistance has been made available for transactions supporting the fight against the pandemic. \nOver a period of seven weeks from April 1, the trade finance program supported over 1,087 transactions valued at approximately $688 million, and supply chain support was extended for 19 medical or pharmaceutical transactions worth over $5.5 million. \nThe supply chain mapping initiative represents a new type of support from ADB’s trade and supply chain finance programs. It leverages the reach and agility of ADB’s financing operations to give unprecedented insights into problems along the supply line and speed their resolution. \nFor example, if a shortage of rubber gaskets is holding up production of ventilators, someone using the ADB tool could quickly look up the companies making those gaskets. With a few clicks, they could see information detailing the size and turnover of those companies, their location, and how many people they employ. \nThey could tell whether those companies only make one particular gasket or whether gaskets are just a small part of their production. They could also see which banks the companies use, providing further information on how to dismantle barriers to financing. \n“This mapping tool helps fill in the information deficit around supply chains and provides a template to ensure supply chain blockages don’t hold up responses to future outbreaks,” said Beck. \nCOVID-19 has exposed the shortcomings of global supply chains. The mapping tool is one way for countries to bridge these fault lines with information that can save lives. \n"},

This is in addition to the $16.7 million of procurement services being undertaken by UNICEF through the same TA. \nMedtecs Group was one of the suppliers selected through the competitive procurement process conducted by PPFD and was awarded a contract for $5 million to produce protective gowns, coveralls and shoe covers to be distributed to frontline health workers in 11 developing member countries. \nThe company has been operating in Cambodia since 1999 and employs 5,500 people at its Kampong Cham factory, with 82% of the workforce composed of female workers.  The factory has provided stable jobs for people living in the surrounding area, contributing to the local economy, which is especially critical as the country braces for economic impact as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown. \nThe entire production, which consisted of nearly 1.2 million garments, took approximately one month, with the company scaling up operations to meet the global PPE demand. The company now has a monthly production capacity of up to 8 million gowns, 2.5 million coveralls and 4 million shoe covers.  The finished goods passed independent third party inspection, and began dispatching from Cambodia in late June for transportation to the various destination countries. \n“This first batch of goods purchased under ADB emergency procurement guidelines for COVID-19 was manufactured in a developing member country, which is also one of the recipients of the finished product. ADB is pleased to play our part in directly procuring and facilitating the mobilization of the urgently needed supplies from global sources, and to different developing member countries.” said Jesper Pedersen, ADB PPFD Principal Procurement Specialist. \n"},

It’s a venture capital investor with a difference. Like all VC investors, ADB Ventures will pursue commercial returns, but it will target investments in companies and technologies that deliver development impact in emerging markets in Asia and the Pacific. ADB Ventures can also provide pre-investment grant support and guidance to businesses exploring and piloting strategies to build commercial scale in these markets. \nADB Ventures is led by Sherwin Pu, head of business development at ADB’s Private Sector Operations Department. He explains ADB Ventures’ mission to help developing Asia attain the SDGs, and its goal to become the region’s largest impact technology platform by 2030. \nADB Ventures is the Asian Development Bank’s new impact-technology investment platform, established in January 2020 and operational since August. Its business model is to deploy venture capital investments and technical assistance to support early-stage technology businesses that can have an impact on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in developing Asia and the Pacific. \nADB Ventures has some unique added-value features that distinguish it from conventional venture capital funds. The inaugural ADB Ventures Investment Fund 1 has a 17-year fund life and is augmented by a three-year, $12 million technical assistance program. This allows us to invest patient capital and help bring best-in-class technology to market, underpinning solutions that make real difference to low-income communities in developing Asia. \n“The private sector and innovative business ideas can play a powerful role in addressing the region’s development challenges.” \nIt’s early days, but we’re making excellent progress. In April 2020, ADB Ventures’ Investment Fund 1 announced it had raised $50 million from multilateral and bilateral development partners, exceeding its close target. The first investors in the fund are Finland’s Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Clean Technology Fund, the Nordic Development Fund, and the Republic of Korea’s Ministry of Economy and Finance. \nTwo technical assistance-funded activities—the ADB Ventures Seed Program and ADB Ventures Labs —will also help us support young companies with fresh ideas. ADB Ventures Labs helps early-stage impact technology companies to discover and develop opportunities to scale-up in developing Asia-Pacific markets. The ADB Ventures Seed Program provides grants to help companies capitalize on market opportunities, and to de-risk expansion into emerging markets that they might otherwise not enter. \nThe Asia Pacific is brimming with innovative early-stage companies with technologies that can have transformational environmental and social impacts in areas like sustainable agriculture, and digital health. \nUnfortunately, these firms struggle to access early-stage capital to finance their growth. This is because risk capital is concentrated in larger, more developed markets. It favors sectors such as e-commerce at the expense of sectors that can deliver direct sustainable development impacts. \nADB Ventures helps to bridge this gap. It can make investments up to $4 million in early-stage businesses with technology-enabled solutions. We invest for commercial returns and prefer to mobilize commercial capital through co-investing with private sector. \nOnce we fund a solution, ADB helps to promote the business across borders to ensure maximum impact. Our regional departments and country resident missions work with ADB Ventures investees to adapt their approach to market country-by-country, and to access unique relationships and opportunities. \nThe private sector and innovative business ideas can play a powerful role in addressing the region’s development challenges. Accordingly, ADB Ventures’ inaugural Investment Fund 1 is focused on early-stage companies with solutions that address climate change and empower women. \nThis informs the choice of sectors that ADB Ventures supports through Investment Fund 1—namely cleantech, inclusive fintech, sustainable agriculture and health technology solutions. \nThrough ADB Ventures Labs , we have helped more than 50 early-stage impact technology companies explore opportunities in developing Asia through initiatives including: \nWe are committed to a minimum of 15 investments and at least 40 grants by 2022 through the Seed Program . So far we’ve provided Seed Program funding to several innovative early-stage impact companies for scalable climate and gender impact. \nADB Ventures provided a Seed Program grant to Piñatex (by Ananas Anam UK Ltd.), a high-end leather substitute made from pineapple leaves, an agricultural waste product. This enables the company to streamline production processes and cut Piñatex’s selling price by 30% - making it more competitive in the genuine and synthetic leather markets. \n“ADB Ventures’ vision is to become the region’s largest impact technology platform, crowding in more than $1 billion of risk capital to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs by 2030.” \nThe development impact of this grant is clear. The fashion industry causes 10% of annual global CO 2 emissions and its escalating demand for cheap leather is making production environmentally unsustainable and unsafe. The company’s Philippines-based operation also provides employment opportunities for local workers, many of whom are women. But our interest in the company is also driven by its high-quality products, incredible unit economics, and customer relationships with leading fashion brands and hotel chains. \nA Seed Program grant has also been provided to Good Brick System (by InnoCSR Co., Ltd.) – a brick-making solution in Nepal that presses bricks with soil stabilizer instead of firing them in a kiln . \nNepal’s nearly 1,600 brick kilns burn 1 million tons of coal every year, according to the World Bank and are responsible for 37% of Nepal’s CO 2 emissions. It causes approximately 600 deaths a year, placing a $46 million annual burden on Nepal’s public health system. But here again, we have strong commercial incentive to invest given the rate of new construction across developing Asia and the opportunity to bring positive change to a brickmaking industry that has changed little over hundreds of years. \nADB Ventures’ vision is to become the region’s largest impact technology platform, crowding in more than $1 billion of risk capital to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs by 2030. Its operations plan has three phases: \nPhase 1: Set-up and launch Our initial target through Investment Fund 1 is to support and invest in technology businesses delivering solutions in parts of Asia where they can have the most impact, particularly on climate change and empowering women. \nPhase 2: Scale across Asia and the Pacific By 2025, ADB Ventures plans to enable multiple financial platforms that support startups with significant potential to scale their operations and deliver impact across Asia Pacific. We also aim to scale our operations across the region, and focus on additional SDGs. \nPhase 3: Become a leading platform in Asia and the Pacific By 2030, ADB Ventures aims to crowd in more than $1 billion of risk capital, reaching $500 million on our investment platform. This means for every $1 we invest, we aim to leverage $2 from the private sector. \n“Our goal is to help these businesses expand into emerging markets across Asia and the Pacific. ” \nThrough venture capital investments and technical assistance, ADB Ventures helps businesses with highly scalable, technology-driven solutions such as conserving energy, reducing waste, fighting climate change, and delivering public services effectively. Our goal is to help these businesses expand into emerging markets across Asia and the Pacific. \nWe start by assessing commercial demand for impact-related technology in the region. Then we source and match best-in-class technology solutions that help ADB’s developing member countries to achieve the SDGs. \nBroadly, we support early-stage companies whose solutions can help achieve SDGs, but which presently don’t have the financing to bring these solutions to market. We do this by reducing market entry risks through partnerships with accelerator programs that specialize in matching early-stage companies with commercial opportunities to support their growth, and by connecting early-stage companies with our own corporate and public sector networks. \nSecond, we enable rapid market validation of solutions offered by early-stage companies by providing reimbursable grant funding up to $200,000. This money reduces market entry risks. Finally, we provide patient capital, investing up to $4 million of venture capital in early-stage growth companies with technology-driven solutions that can improve lives and livelihoods in across the region. \nFor inquiries, contact the ADB Ventures team . \n"},

Cyclone Ian in 2014 and Cyclone Gita in 2018, for example, both caused immense damage to livelihoods and infrastructure in the island nation, including the country’s power supply. \nWhen that happens, it’s a disaster for the likes of Dr ‘Ana ‘Akau’ola, the Acting Superintendent of Vaiola Hospital in Nuku’alofa, the Tongan capital. The only radiologist in Tonga, Dr. ‘Ana relies heavily on the supply of reliable electricity to do her job. So when Cyclone Harold swept through Tonga in April, Dr. ‘Ana was pleasantly surprised when the hospital lost power for just one day—not weeks, as was the case for previous cyclones. \nThat resilience is the result of ADB’s ongoing support of Tonga Power Limited (TPL) to help enhance the climate resiliency of power lines, underground cables, and electricity poles—and improve the lives of Tongan people. \nIn an interview with ADB, Dr. ‘Ana talked about the challenges of operating a hospital with an unreliable power supply and how Tonga’s more resilient infrastructure has benefited the lives of doctors and patients in Vaiola Hospital. \nThis interview was conducted over the phone and has been lightly edited for length and clarity. \nSince Tonga closed its borders to the world, I have been Acting Superintendent of Vaiola Hospital. I oversee hospital operations and much of my work is focused on the preparation for COVID-19, which has been ongoing since the beginning of the year. We are extremely lucky there are no cases here, but we are prepared. \nAs Tonga’s only radiologist, I run the radiology department at Vaiola and conduct radiology activities for the other smaller hospitals in the outer islands. \nEverything we do in radiology needs electricity. From the computers I use to read my x-rays, the ultrasound machines, CT scans and the mammograms we perform. If the power goes off, I may as well go home. I cannot do my job. \nImagine what it is like if you are a hospital patient who relies on a ventilator to breathe and the power cuts out, or you are a surgeon and there is a power surge mid-way through an operation. Power cuts are life-threatening in those situations and generators can often take some time to start. \nUnreliable power takes us back to what medicine was like 30 plus years ago—when we only had our knowledge, a stethoscope, and our hands as tools to make diagnoses. \nThese days we rely on electricity to power the machines we use to accurately diagnose patients sooner. \nYes, I have noticed a big difference. It is clear the upgrading work that was conducted between Cyclone Gita in 2018 and Cyclone Harold in early 2020, has really paid off and made the powerlines and the grid more resilient to disasters. For example, after Cyclone Gita, at the hospital we were without power for nearly a week, causing major disruption for patients and staff. After Cyclone Harold earlier this year, in comparison, the power went out and it was back on the next day. Minimal disruption and minimal stress for all of us at the hospital. I have also noticed that since the upgrading work was done, we have had far fewer power surges. TPL have improved their communications with the hospital. If they need to temporarily turn off the power while they undergo upgrading or maintenance work, they give us plenty of notice so we can plan for it. \n"},

That, in turn, has highlighted another reality: the importance of universal health coverage (UHC). Achieving UHC means that everybody can access the quality health services they need without suffering financial hardship. Countries that have made strong commitments to UHC have been able to better manage the health impacts of the pandemic—and therefore, the economic impacts as well. \nADB and WHO members in the Asia-Pacific region are making headway toward the goal of achieving UHC. Here are four examples of how countries in our region have made significant progress towards UHC and how their health systems have limited the impact of COVID-19. \nApproximately 97% of Korea’s population is insured through the country’s universal single-payer healthcare system, which resulted from two milestones: the adoption of UHC in 1989 and then the merging of 370 insurance funds into to a single-payer system in 2000. Korea’s health system is mostly financed through the National Health Insurance (NHI) system and generally delivered by private health providers. All health providers are mandated to participate in the NHI and to treat patients under the same benefit packages and provider payments set by the NHI law. Total health spending is relatively high, at about 8.0% of GDP as of 2019, with 4.9% of GDP spending coming from government or compulsory sources.   The country’s robust health infrastructure includes a high number of hospital beds per capita—12.3 beds per 1,000 people—along with 254 health care centers, more than 1,300 sub-health centers, over 1,900 primary health care posts, and 46 community health promotion centers across the country as of 2018. Significant investments in health data and technology have also been made in the country. These have been used to improve quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of service delivery. \nKorea’s response to COVID-19 owes much to experience gained from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, particularly the formation of an agency tasked with preparing for, and responding to, infectious disease outbreaks, the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). In the early days of COVID-19, Korea adopted a widespread testing strategy that included people who were asymptomatic. The roll-out of rapid diagnostic testing was a key pillar of the country’s response and relied largely on the country’s ability to quickly develop and manufacture tests. Shortly after the country’s first case was confirmed, KCDC officials met with more than 20 private sector partners to discuss mass production of COVID-19 testing kits. Within one week, on 4 February, the first company had been authorized to begin producing testing kits. In early February, testing was expanded with the help of a new, single-step, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kit, which gave results in just six hours. By 20 February,12,000 people were tested in the country; by 8 March, over 180,000 people were tested. This enabled public health officials to track the spread of disease and effectively implement control measures. \nSri Lanka has made steady and substantial progress towards UHC since 1931, with the government ensuring adequate access to free public healthcare services. The health system covers everyone equally and healthcare is free at the point of delivery. It is publicly funded through general tax payments and is solely controlled by the public sector. The health system in Sri Lanka is pluralistic, encompassing both the public and private sectors. Although the public system provides good quality healthcare at no cost to patients from primary to tertiary levels, Sri Lankans still rely heavily on the private sector for outpatient care, which involves out-of-pocket payments. \nSri Lanka has prioritized its health spending on expanding and maintaining its infrastructure —a health facility is available within four kilometers of every household. This network of health facilities in both rural and urban areas allows services to be provided across the entire island. Sri Lanka also prioritizes the health of its aging population by creating a separate unit in the Ministry of Health that will collaborate with the Ministry of Social Services in the design and implementation of relevant policies. This will contribute to the welfare of the country’s elderly population, which is projected to reach 30% by 2050. \nSri Lanka's network of geographically accessible health facilities and a health system with no financial barriers enabled the country to efficiently respond to COVID-19. The health system allows everyone access to government facilities for free testing and treatment. In addition, the president set up a high-level task force to combat COVID-19 using an all-of-government and whole-of-society approach emphasizing testing, tracing, and treatment activities, in addition to strict lockdowns with travel restrictions. \nThailand adopted a UHC policy in 2002. Its health insurance scheme, which covers close to 75% of the population, is funded through general taxes and managed by the National Health Security Office (NHSO), which allocates funding based on capitation, such as numbers of registered UHC-eligible members in service areas, for outpatient care and diagnosis-related group-based payments for inpatient care. Two decades after the introduction of its UHC policy, Thailand continues to monitor UHC population coverage, service coverage (both preventive and curative), and financial risk protection. According to the WHO Global Health Expenditure database, out-of-pocket expenditure has declined substantially—from 34% in 2001 to 14.8% in 2007 and 11.1% in 2017. \nThe country’s successful implementation of UHC, and its ability to achieve good health at a relative low cost, is largely due to comprehensive geographical coverage of primary health care (PHC)—with almost 9,800 health centers acting as gatekeepers for referral to secondary and tertiary care. Even before the implementation of UHC, and over the past four decades, Thailand had substantially invested in basic healthcare infrastructure and human resources for health. Since the 1970s, one of the unique contributors to the Thai health system has been the large corps of Village Health Volunteers (VHV), totalling more than one million. These VHV have helped support the prevention, detection, and reporting of COVID-19—minimising local transmissions, raising awareness in the community, and encouraging people to comply with disease control measures. \nThailand implemented a decisive, coordinated response to COVID-19, including the formation of the Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration, a national task force that provided daily briefings to the public, and implementing rolling curfews, lockdowns, and restrictions on international and domestic travel. In July, it had set up more than 200 COVID-19 laboratories to expand testing, while the country’s network of public and private hospitals has kept the fatality rate under 2%. On 21 August, the government announced Thailand had gone more than a month with no new cases. \nViet Nam has invested heavily in its public health care system and health spending has outpaced the country’s recent booming economic growth. Since 2000, for every 1.0 percent increase in GDP per capita, public spending on health has increased by 1.7%. This has translated to an almost three-fold increase of spending in constant US dollars, from $46.2 spent on health per capita in 2000 to $129.6 in 2017. A social health insurance scheme was introduced in Viet Nam in 1992 and between 2000 and 2017, coverage in the scheme increased from 13% to 87% of Viet Nam’s population. Viet Nam’s tiered health system infrastructure also helps to ensure that local needs are met. Across the country, there are more than 13,000 public facilities, with an additional 35,000 health facilities in the private sector. Viet Nam’s health system is also performing well in terms of ensuring financial protection. The incidence of catastrophic health expenditure has reduced from 14.4% in 2006 to 9.4% in 2016 (at the 10% threshold). The country is also prioritizing preventive care: at least 30% of the total health budget is allocated for preventive services. As part of its commitment to achieving UHC and strengthening preventive care, Viet Nam has been moving toward building national emergency preparedness and response capacities to improve health security. \nViet Nam has been hailed for its response to COVID-19, issuing public health warnings based on risk assessment before the first had appeared in the country, instituting rigorous contact-tracing procedures, closing borders, and introducing the Prime Minister’s Directives on nationwide social distancing. However, the resurgence of cases in July in the coastal city of Da Nang and other cities/ provinces underscored the flexibility and responsiveness of Viet Nam’s health system. Rapid response teams and additional health workers were deployed to the outbreak’s epicenter, followed by the establishment of a 200-bed field hospital, the conversion of a stadium to a 1000-bed isolation facility, and the expansion of testing capacity. While number of cases increased dramatically during the first two weeks of August, the situation now appears largely under control. Viet Nam’s investment in UHC, particularly in preventive measures, have helped to ensure that sufficient infrastructure and systems existed to support COVID-19 response. \n"},

Her family of six lives in a 20-square-meter dwelling in Navotas City, northwest of the capital Manila. “We were so happy, as well as all our neighbors. The relief goods were a big blessing to us, especially since my husband is a passenger jeepney driver and he can’t work now, so we don’t know where to get money for food.” \nThe previous day, Dela Cruz, her husband, Federico, and her 70-year-old father-in-law who lives with them and has a lung ailment, had skipped dinner, lunch, and breakfast. Her three children, including an infant, had consumed only milk and bread. Her husband had to give up his job temporarily when enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) started in Metro Manila on 16 March. The ECQ is one of the government’s emergency measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 and save lives. \nWe felt strongly that we had to play our part during these extraordinary times to immediately help the poor and vulnerable groups \nThe Dela Cruz family is just one of tens of thousands of poor Filipino households who have received food supplies under the Bayan Bayanihan, a food program launched by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in partnership with the Philippines’ Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the private sector, in coordination with the Philippine Army. \nBayan Bayanihan , based on the traditional Filipino Bayanihan principle of community spirit, was funded through a $5 million technical assistance under the Rapid Emergency Supplies Provision project approved by ADB on 26 March 2020. The project addresses the health crisis caused by COVID-19 by delivering critical food supplies to as many as 140,000 vulnerable households in Metro Manila and neighboring provinces. Target beneficiaries are the poor and marginalized, including people with disabilities and the elderly, as well as daily wage earners in the informal labor market. \n“We felt strongly that we had to play our part during these extraordinary times to immediately help the poor and vulnerable groups,” said ADB’s Director General for Southeast Asia Ramesh Subramaniam, who led Bayan Bayanihan . “At the same time, we worked with the government to rapidly prepare our broader support for the country’s fiscal stimulus programs and social protection initiatives.\" \nSubramaniam said the program was designed to complement national and local governments’ immediate efforts to provide for the basic needs of Filipinos, especially those living in relatively remote areas or far from retail facilities or food markets. \nADB’s approval of the project spurred a rush of online coordination meetings that went late into the night. Hundreds of phone calls were made between program partners including the private sector. Systems and procedures were immediately put in place for emergency distribution of food supplies. \nADB staff led the food procurement and distribution schedules, and worked with the DSWD to identify the neediest communities. The Philippine Army deployed more than 400 soldiers and civilians to distribute and pack the goods into canvas bags each containing 35 cans of sardines, tuna flakes, corned beef, and other items. \nAssembled in line with DSWD specifications, the food packs and accompanying 10-kilogram sacks of rice can sustain a family of five for a week. Army soldiers, together with DSWD representatives, visited target communities days before distribution to validate poverty data and coordinate with village captains and social workers to ensure smooth flow of goods from army trucks to doorsteps. \nOn March 31, five days after the project approval, Philippine Army trucks rolled out of Army headquarters in Taguig City with rice for 2,000 target households in four cities in Metro Manila -- Pasay, Caloocan, Quezon, and Manila. On 4 April, Army trucks started going deep into hard-to-reach barangays or villages, delivering 4,613 food packs to residents of Barangay Hulong Duhat in Malabon City. E-tricycles and bicycle taxis were hired to take the food packs to residents who lived down narrow alleyways, allowing them to abide by government guidelines to limit movement outside their homes. \nBy 30 April, around 100,000 poor households, or half a million people, from all over Metro Manila had received food packs, including people with disabilities in Caloocan City. Contributions from large private sector and philanthropic partners, such as the Philippine Disaster Relief Foundation and Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry enabled distribution to at least 40,000 more households. The program will end in May. \n“We had other groups doing the same thing, but what made ADB’s program of Bayan Bayanihan really matter was the fact that we had a decision to give more,” said Ambassador Marciano Paynor, Jr., a seasoned diplomat and former Chief of Presidential Protocol who helped organize coordination systems for the program. “We are reaching out to the poorest of the poor. We are able to alleviate their hunger. And with this extended ECQ, then all the more you see the importance of having given them the amount that we gave and the places we have been to.” \nAleli Mantequilla, a 39-year-old who works at a biscuit factory and whose 9-year-old son is a person with disability, said the food packs allowed them to stay at home in Caloocan City. \n“It is enough for at least two weeks, so we need not go out of the house during this time when it is so dangerous for our health, especially since my son cannot get sick. The food supplies also gave us some peace of mind. We can reallocate our money for paying house bills which are sure to come after the quarantine is lifted,” Mantequilla said \nLieutenant General Gilbert Gapay, Philippine Army chief, said the program also employed as packers 250 students and caddies working at the Philippine Army golf course who had lost their jobs during the quarantine. \n“They work on rotation in batches of 50 to 60, so that all of them will have income,” said General Gapay. “So apart from addressing the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 to poor communities, the program is also helping individuals who lost their jobs. We thank ADB for that.” \nDespite risks to their health as frontline workers of the food program, Philippine Army and Navy personnel toiled almost daily to pack and bring food supplies to neighborhoods. \n“We derive satisfaction and fulfillment out of helping these poor people, the needy,” General Gapay said. “We also draw inspiration and strength knowing that we have staunch partners willing to serve, like ADB.” \n"},

Тратится топливо, загрязняется воздух, выделяются парниковые газы и происходит ненужный износ двигателя. \nПри запуске двигателя автомобиля масло циркулирует по всему блоку двигателя для смазки движущихся частей. В зимние дни, когда двигатель холодный, масло очень густое, и двигатель должен работать усерднее для преодоления внутреннего трения. \nПри температуре окружающей среды ниже 0°C двигатель после \"холодного пуска\" может потреблять примерно на 25% больше топлива, чем при нормальной рабочей температуре двигателя. Для среднестатистического автомобиля с 3-литровым двигателем каждые 10 минут холостого хода расходуют более четверти литра топлива впустую. \nТакже, помимо пустого расхода топлива, холостой ход может приводить к выбросу парниковых газов, что оказывает влияние на изменение климата. Диоксид углерода (CO 2 ), наиболее распространенный парниковый газ, является неизбежным побочным продуктом сжигания бензина или дизельного топлива. Чем больше топлива используется, тем больше выбросов парниковых газов вырабатывается. \nЧтобы уменьшить воздействие от запуска холодного двигателя автомобиля в зимние месяцы, предпусковой электроподогрев блока двигателя широко используется в северных регионах, таких как Канада, Финляндия, Швеция, Норвегия и Аляска. Технология используется уже более 50 лет. \nТехнология предпускового электроподогрева блока двигателя автомобиля прогревает двигатель припаркованного автомобиля в холодные зимние месяцы. Как маленький электрический чайник, он прогревает двигатель с помощью внешней электрической розетки.  Дополнительный обогреватель салона можно использовать для обогрева автомобиля и борьбы с оледенением стекол в холодные дни. Данная технология позволяет избежать холостого хода двигателя. Технология экономит топливо, снижает загрязнение воздуха и продлевает срок службы автомобиля. \nТехнология предпускового электроподогрева блока двигателя автомобиля состоит из трех основных компонентов: \nВ очень холодные зимние дни люди часто заводят двигатель на холостом ходу, чтобы прогреть салон автомобиля перед началом движения. Каждый сжигаемый литр бензина производит около 2,3 кг углекислого газа (двуокись углерода), парникового газа, который вызывает глобальное потепление и изменение климата. Чем больше топлива используется, тем больше углекислого газа производится. Один из способов сократить расход топлива - избежать ненужного холостого прогрева двигателя. \nОдин обычный автомобиль с 2,5-литровым бензиновым двигателем на холостом ходу в течение 60 минут в день в течение 200-дневного зимнего сезона в Нур-Султане (Казахстан) потребляет около 646 литров топлива. \nСжигание топлива также менее эффективно при холодном пуске двигателя, так как для эффективного сгорания в нем должно быть больше топлива и меньше воздуха.  Это приводит к резкому увеличению выбросов, таких как твердые частицы (сажа), а также большое количество монооксида углерода (CO), оксидов азота (NO X ), диоксида серы (SO 2 ) и летучих органических соединений (ЛОС). Эти выбросы влияют на качество воздуха, особенно на людей с астмой, пожилых людей и маленьких детей. \nПри температуре -20°C предпусковой электроподогрев блока двигателя может увеличить общую экономию топлива примерно на 10%. Для одной короткой поездки при температуре -25°C экономия топлива может составить порядка 25 процентов. \nТехнология предпускового электроподогрева блока двигателя автомобиля также позволит существенно сократить выбросы загрязняющих веществ в атмосферу и парниковых газов. \nЗа счет широкого внедрения технологии предпускового электроподогрева блока двигателя, Нур-Султан может сократить потребление топлива на 220 миллионов литров и  углеродные выбросы на 430 000 тонн. Ниже представлена таблица расчетов выбросов от 350 000 автомобилей в городе Нур-Султан. \nРиски и его влияние на здоровье \nИсточник: Расчеты Азиатского банка развития \nУстановка предпускового электроподогрева блока двигателя и подогрева салона аналогична установке уличного освещения. Стоимость будет зависеть от таких факторов, как цены на топливо, температура зимой и предпочтения водителей. \nТехнология предпускового электроподогрева блока двигателя автомобиля является проверенным методом экономии финансовых средств, повышения комфорта, уменьшения загрязнения окружающей среды и сокращения износа двигателя. Это также улучшает качество воздуха, принося пользу жителям города. \nGovernment of Canada. Natural Resources Canada. 2008.

With more than a third of the global population under some level of lockdown, we’ve delighted to see skies burst back into blueness and wild animals venturing into urban neighborhoods. It’s been easy to convince ourselves that wildlife and the environment have flourished. The truth, however, isn’t so reassuring. The pandemic has created an increase in poaching, animal trafficking, illegal fishing and other environmental crimes. It’s caused a surge in food, plastic, and infectious medical waste. And it’s put a roadblock in front of a much-needed international agreement on key biodiversity and climate goals. \nWith countries across Asia and the Pacific gradually loosening their quarantines, we must bring the focus back to nature and address the pandemic through green and inclusive recovery. For many, this will be a challenge because of the high demand for healthcare and social protection. But the choice between the environment on the one hand and the economy on the other is a false one. Experts have found that green investments generate significant jobs and sustainable benefits to economies. Early investment is also ultimately cheaper than the trillions of dollars needed to respond to future crises. As we begin to emerge from months of lockdown, here are six measures that decision-makers can take to jumpstart their own green recoveries. \nRecent air quality improvement and reduced carbon emission from lockdowns can be sustained by continuing flexible working arrangements and enabling the use of non-motorized transport. Cities such as Bogotá and Sydney are creating designated lanes and pathways for walking and biking to reduce crowding on public transport and provide a safe and healthy way to exercise. Governments can further improve air quality through policy reforms, incentives, and investments in sustainable transport, clean energy, and green urban planning. \nAcross Asia and the Pacific, millions of people lack access to basic drinking water or sanitation services, making it challenging to follow handwashing and other hygiene guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Emergency water provision, handwashing facilities, and temporary latrines can be provided to communities and waste sector workers, coupled with campaigns that teach and encourage proper handwashing. Disposal of medical waste must follow proper guidelines to minimize pollution and the spread of disease. In the medium term, investments to improve water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management (including the 3Rs of ‘reduce, reuse, recycle’) should be substantially increased to protect human health and the natural environment. \nProtecting the region’s natural capital and developing sustainable land-use practices are crucial to reducing future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases. This will require increased enforcement of regulations against poaching, wildlife trafficking, and habitat destruction. Governments can use stimulus funds to hire additional wildlife rangers and increase the use of remote monitoring technologies such as camera traps and drones in compliance with physical distancing requirements and travel restrictions. To curb wildlife trade, there is growing public support in Asian countries to close illegal and unregulated wildlife markets . Provinces in the People’s Republic of China have developed compensation schemes for farmers to transition from breeding exotic animals for trade to rearing other livestock or producing tea and herbal medicines. To restore ecosystems, governments can create cash-for-work programs for environmental public works, such as river restoration, and pest control to benefit native wildlife. \nUrban and community farming has grown in popularity to address food and nutritional needs due to the supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19 lockdowns. Fruits and vegetables grown in just 10% of a city's gardens and green spaces can provide 15% of the local population with their basic needs. Investing in urban agriculture and related services can generate jobs at a rate of 1 for every 50-100 citizens. It also saves energy and reduces emissions from storage and transportation, can reduce retail prices for consumers. Urban gardens can also provide environmental benefits. Governments may consider supporting resilient and localized food supply chains to ensure continued production and distribution of safe, diversified, and nutritious food while protecting livelihoods, the environment, and health. Such support should include improving access to high-speed internet services to expand agricultural e-commerce. \nSome of these ideas are already happening. In the wake of the pandemic, Singapore has initiated a grant program for local farmers and entrepreneurs as part of a plan to meet 30% of its nutritional needs with locally-grown food by 2030. In the Philippines, government agencies are providing urban residents with seeds, planting materials, and training to create urban vegetable gardens. Governments can also encourage agroecology and agroforestry farming approaches, as well as integrated pest management, to help restore soil and forests, strengthen food security and climate resilience, and protect livelihoods. \nThis is a key way countries can address unemployment and rebuild economies. Green business sectors can provide resilient livelihood opportunities while improvements in digital infrastructure can support remote working, telehealth, and e-commerce. To address unemployment resulting from the crisis, economists have recommended education and training for green jobs . Livelihood programs can support restoring and enhancing natural capital, such as Pakistan’s 10 Billion Tree Tsunami program, or rehabilitating green urban spaces and nature-based tourism destinations. \nMicro, small- and medium-sized enterprises, which employ the most people in Asia and the Pacific, will need financial and technical assistance to adopt green technologies and transition to green business models, products, and services. Support for larger companies can be linked with actions to improve their environmental performance, which can include information disclosure and greening their supply chains. Sustainable solutions to adapt industries to the new normal, such as developing and monetizing virtual tourism experiences, should also be promoted. \nThe Global Commission on Adaptation has estimated that investing $1.8 trillion globally from 2020 to 2030 in resilience-building measures could generate $7.1 trillion in total new benefits. Therefore, stimulus support for large infrastructure investments should ensure that projects are designed and planned to be ecologically sensitive, low-carbon, and resilient to climate and disaster impacts. Nature-based solutions—such as protecting coral reefs or restoring mangrove forests to act as natural buffers against storm surges—are cost-effective and have major co-benefits for biodiversity, ecosystems food supply, local economic opportunities (like tourism) and provide aesthetic and cultural benefits to communities. Farmers can implement climate-resilient farming tactics that preserve open areas to absorb increasing volumes of rain during the monsoon season. \nInnovative financing mechanisms will be needed to meet the large investment needs of a transformative green recovery. Environment, social, and governance (ESG) investments have performed better than the broader market in the early months of the pandemic and may be key to integrating support for environmental sustainability into stimulus packages. Financial institutions can issue green and blue bonds to raise capital and invest in programs and project to provide growth, and jobs while delivering environmental benefits. The Export-Import Bank of Korea's green recovery initiative is a good example. Countries can also use or reform economic instruments such as taxes, levies, penalties, and subsidies for collecting domestic revenues and providing incentives for stimulating sustainable and low-carbon investments to achieve a green recovery and longer-term, climate-resilient development. \n"},

ADB’s Country Director for Afghanistan Narendra Singru explains how regional cooperation can benefit Afghanistan and the wider CAREC region. \nAfghanistan’s geographic position as a strategic bridge and connecting hub between Central and South Asia offers many opportunities for economic cooperation. Regional cooperation, as a building block, not only helps Afghanistan leverage its economic growth, but also creates catalytic impact in addressing the prevailing challenges of poverty, security, and terrorism. \nTo support regional cooperation and integration, Afghanistan joined the CAREC Program in 2005 and has since been working closely with other member countries to restore the country to its traditional place as a crossroads of cultures and commerce, and promote peace, prosperity, and stability in the wider region. \nCAREC’s other members are Azerbaijan, the People’s Republic of China, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \nUnder its CAREC 2030 strategy , the program will continue to support Afghanistan in developing its potential as a regional transit hub with an emphasis on major road and rail corridors. It will also support regional energy initiatives such as the Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India (TAPI) gas pipeline, and the Turkmenistan–Uzbekistan–Tajikistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan (TUTAP) electricity project. \nCAREC also promotes trade facilitation initiatives and the development of agriculture market infrastructure and value chains. This will help Afghanistan maximize the value of its natural resources, build human capacity, and create more jobs and opportunities for local businesses. \nAs of 2019, the CAREC Program had invested around $4.46 billion in 37 projects in Afghanistan, on the principle that better connections will be key to unlocking the region’s vast resources and human potential. We are currently processing new projects for approval in 2020 that will further enhance regional development. \nAs of 2019, the CAREC Program had invested around $4.46 billion in 37 projects in Afghanistan, on the principle that better connections will be key to unlocking the region’s vast resources and human potential. \nAs Afghanistan’s leading partner in infrastructure and regional cooperation, ADB is helping develop Afghanistan’s potential as a cross-regional transit point for both transport and energy, with emphasis on the CAREC corridors and regional energy initiatives. \nOur experience shows that infrastructure development remains key to inclusive economic growth and improving access to opportunities for both women and men. Since resuming its operations in Afghanistan in 2002, ADB has committed around $5.9 billion to the country. Our operations currently focus on the agriculture and natural resources, energy, and transport sectors with special attention to regional cooperation, improved governance, and capacity building. \nLet me briefly highlight some of our main achievements. In the energy sector , ADB funded projects have supported the construction of 1,971 km (605 km completed, 1,366 km ongoing) of high-voltage power transmission lines and 19 (15 completed, 4 ongoing) substations. The assistance has helped to enhance regional connectivity, extend the national grid connectivity, and provide reliable and affordable electricity to people in many provinces who were previously not connected to the grid. \nIn transport, ADB projects have supported the construction and rehabilitation of 1,055 km of roads while work continues on an additional 465 km of national and regional roads. The support has improved regional connectivity, safety, efficiency, and sustainability in Afghanistan’s transport sector. ADB also financed the first railway line between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, which carries 3 million to 4 million tons of freight annually between the two countries, and helped complete a feasibility study for 813 km of rail line to connect Afghanistan with Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. \nAnd in agriculture and natural resources, ADB-funded projects have helped construct and rehabilitate around 350,000 hectares of irrigated land, while work continues on an additional 300,000 hectares. The completed projects have generated around 2 million short and long-term jobs and benefited more than 9 million people. \nADB-funded projects have helped construct and rehabilitate around 350,000 hectares of irrigated land, while work continues on an additional 300,000 hectares. The completed projects have generated around 2 million short and long-term jobs and benefited more than 9 million people. \nAfghanistan is classified by ADB as being in a fragile and conflict-affected situation (FCAS) . In addition to the limited technical and financial capacities, the deteriorating security situation in the country makes it difficult for ADB and other development partners to keep project implementation on track. \nConsidering these, ADB has developed an FCAS toolkit and Enhanced Project Delivery Approach (EPDA) to improve the implementation of projects in the short and medium terms given the fragile and conflicted-affected context of the country. Although conditions have improved since 2002, Afghanistan needs further support to make development assistance more effective. \nIn addition to the aforementioned support, ADB approved a $40 million grant to support Afghanistan’s fight against the pandemic. The support includes construction of hospitals and medical facilities, procurement of urgently needed medicines and medical equipment, and training frontline health workers and support staff in COVID-19 surveillance, prevention, testing, treatment, and risk management. \nIn July 2020, ADB handed over the first consignment of personal protective equipment to the Ministry of Public Health to help protect frontline health workers who are at high risk of being infected with COVID-19 while providing care. The support is part of a $2.73 million grant—financed under ADB’s technical assistance on Regional Support to Address the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). \nGiven Afghanistan’s strategic location, controlling the spread of COVID-19 has important benefits for its neighbors and more broadly for the CAREC subregion. ADB will provide support in areas such as regional public goods, mitigating risks at the borders, and enhancing collaboration and knowledge sharing on responding effectively to the pandemic. \nADB administers the Afghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund (AITF)—a flagship vehicle for financing large or complex infrastructure projects. Many projects are financially beyond the capacity of the government or any single donor. AITF allows the strategic pooling of funds—from governments, bilateral and multilateral partners, and the private sector—to develop the vital infrastructure that Afghanistan needs. \nThe AITF has grown steadily and its financial performance continues to improve. Currently $743.5 million has been pledged to AITF. Donors have flexible options on how to contribute, according to their priorities. Expanding AITF will help to build on existing gains. We will continue to work with the government and donor partners to channel additional resources to invest in much-needed infrastructure projects through AITF. \n"},
{"organization": "Asian Development Bank", "category": "articles", "crawlTime": "2020-10-30", "title": "After COVID-19, How do We Bring Tourism Back Better?", "issueAgency": "ADB", "issueTime": "5 June 2020", "abstract": "Here are four key recovery priorities for the tourism sector.", "url": "https://www.adb.org/news/features/after-covid-19-how-do-we-bring-tourism-back-better", "detail": "By Sanya Grover, SDCC Intern \nThe almost complete suspension of international travel has been one of the major elements of the quarantines introduced during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. While this has brought misery for those who love to travel, it’s brought decimation for airlines, hotels, and tourism operators. The UNWTO has estimated that Asia and the Pacific’s tourism industry felt the largest negative impact from COVID-19, with tourist arrivals down almost 33 million in the first trimester of 2020. The International Labour Organization has called the impact “devastating.” \nThen, there are the environmental impacts. The pandemic has put rural areas under pressure from changed land use, loss of biodiversity, and illegal poaching activities. Fishing, mining, deforestation, and other illegal nature-based activities are on the rise. With the pandemic stretching hospital resources, biomedical waste is also increasing, as is the use of single-use plastics for things like food, drinks, and deliveries. \nWith quarantines easing and flight schedules reforming, tourism is showing signs of returning. But for the industry to return as a force for good for both the economy and the environment, we cannot return to business as usual. Here are four key recovery priorities for the tourism sector: \nWhen tourism resumes, domestic travel will be the focus, putting destinations under the dangers of mass tourism, in which the number of incoming tourists exceeds a destination’s capacity to hold them. Viet Nam will be the first country in South East Asia to resume domestic travel, with discounted packages and promotions aimed at building demand. Other countries are also focusing on a few prime locations for attracting tourists. Rebuilding the tourism sector and providing tourists with rewarding experiences must be done by exploring alternatives to mass tourism, such as sustainable rural tourism, nature tourism, and theme-based circuit tourism. \nUnguarded protected areas and the diverted attention of governments has led to a rise in nature-based crime. With the decline in wildlife tourism, revenue streams for conservation have also dried up. Stringent laws for biodiversity protection and illegal activities are needed. To protect the ecological balance from tourism, governments can consider: increased focus and investment in capacity building and training; inclusion of sustainability taxes for tourists; protecting sensitive community and Indigenous People’s areas from exploitation; and including scientific frameworks for policy formulation. \nInfrastructure for waste management needs to be improved and all public places must have provisions for the safe disposal of bio-medical waste. Increasing access to clean water and sanitation services, along with the promotion of good hygiene practices like hand washing, would also help to stop the spread of communicable diseases. Incentives must also be made to internet service providers to improve connectivity in tourist destinations. \nTax reforms must be done, with consideration of tax levies for frequent flyers. Many aviation companies are nearing bankruptcy, leading to an increased demand for government bailouts. However, this funding must come with conditions prioritizing environmental improvements. In France, for example, a €7 billion bailout for Air France came with the requirement for it to become the “greenest airline in the world.” Other steps can include retiring inefficient aircraft, reducing the number of flights while demand is low, and providing carbon efficiency information for flyers. \nTaken together, these strategies can help ensure that policy decisions are informed by careful and scientific formulations. Protecting the key assets of a region—the very reason for tourist arrivals—is a fundamental pillar of any recovery, ensuring we don’t solve one problem by creating another. When planned and implemented strategically, tourism as a sector can match up to its potential of being a driver of social, economic, and environmental welfare. \n"},

Now is not the time to start cutting the connections that have raised millions from poverty and helped to build the global economy that we have today. \nPhysical borders can be closed to those who might pass on the virus, but the crisis underlines the importance of other connections, such as trade. At a time when streamlining trade should be at the top of the agenda, so that critical goods such as food and medicine can move to where they are needed, too many have seen the pandemic as a reason to turn inward. \nPhysical borders can be closed to those who might pass on the virus, but the crisis underlines the importance of other connections, such as trade. \nThe global trading system has been tested by the pandemic’s effects. Weaknesses in the current system have been exposed. There is no denying that. An overreliance on manufacturing in a single location for some goods is one indication that supply chains may be more fragile than previously thought. When factories closed to fight the virus, key medical goods suddenly became scarce. More subtle weaknesses have also been highlighted by the crisis. \nGlobal trade and the financial system that supports it has traditionally been a paper-intensive arena, with hand-delivered documents in triplicate needed to move goods at every stage. That system was already antiquated before the crisis. Now, the need to digitize the trading world is even more urgent. \nDigitization has proven to be important in other areas as well. Beyond trade and supply chains, consider the situation in countries in which entire populations have joined the digital ranks—digital identifiers, electronic banking and accounts—versus those that have been slow to adapt. Governments that have been trying to help their citizens have found it much easier to deliver that help when they have access to solid records and mobile and digital banking. \nAnother weakness exposed by the crisis has been found in the tariffs and other trade barriers that have come into play. As people searched for alternate sources of key products, they found some of them stuck behind trade barriers that seemed to have no reason to exist. \nA recent study found that out of 164 members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), only 50 do not tax imported medical devices. Seventy-nine governments went into the crisis taxing imported soap at rates of 15 percent or more, noted the study by Professor Simon J. Evenett of the Swiss Institute for International Economics and the Department of Economics. \nThere have been attempts to strengthen the global trade and supply-chain system, even while it is under such a strain. Some have looked to find solutions within the current systems by making it easier to find alternate suppliers of key goods. Others have seen the pandemic as an excuse to abandon the global system, at least when it comes to goods seen as strategically important to their national wellbeing. Instead of providing an opportunity to shore up any weaknesses in the system, there is now a danger that the global crisis will be used as an excuse to “onshore” more and more goods considered to be of key strategic importance. Instead of becoming stronger, the global trading system could be weakened further. \nCountries need easy access to medicines, medical equipment and other goods vital to the health of their populations. Few countries make everything they need themselves, which means the flow of trade in those goods needs to be through gates that are opened wider, not shut. If everyone starts trying to make everything themselves, the weaknesses exposed in the global system by the crisis could become gaping wounds. The reality of comparative advantage and its positive impacts on productivity, global growth and development may be in jeopardy. The system that has proven such a benefit to the world, even with its flaws, is now in even more doubt. \nThat’s why it is important that the efforts to strengthen the global trading system continue and that they are ramped up even more as the crisis is overcome. \nThe aim of this supply-chain mapping tool is to identify blockages and other impediments to these critical goods being produced and distributed to where they’re needed. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other multilateral institutions have been working to plug holes in the system, along with private-sector players that also have an interest in ensuring that global trade emerges from the crisis in better shape. When it became clear that essential medical items were becoming scarce and that alternate sources for those goods were hard to find, the ADB’s Trade & Supply Chain Finance Program (TSCFP) began a project to map the supply chains for those products. \nThe aim of this supply-chain mapping tool is to identify blockages and other impediments to these critical goods being produced and distributed to where they’re needed. In May, the first phase of the project was completed: interactive maps that enable banks, investors, governments and healthcare professionals to pinpoint key companies in the supply of portable ventilators, N95 respirator masks, face shields, goggles, aprons, surgical masks and gowns. The maps consider the elements of each product down to its component metals and fabrics. \nSince then, the supply-chain maps have been extended to other products. We’re looking at supply-chain maps for vaccines, including the distribution channels required to administer the drug when it becomes available. Anyone can use the tool, free of charge, through the ADB website. \nThe ADB is also working in more conventional ways to support those affected by the crisis. It has pledged $20 billion for a range of measures to help its members through the crisis and has approved changes to streamline its operations for quicker and more flexible delivery of assistance. As part of that, working in partnership with commercial banks, the ADB is providing companies in Asia and the Pacific with additional working capital to meet expansion and other requirements. That support includes an additional $200 million of supply-chain finance to help companies in areas that are critical to fighting the virus to ramp up production of items such as test kits, N95 masks and ventilators. Given that a single pool of supply-chain finance is typically used for a subsequent delivery over a period of 120–180 days, this facility could support more than $400 million of financing over the next 12 months. Fifty-fifty risk sharing from partner commercial banks could boost support under the facility to $800 million over the same period. \nCombined trade and supply-chain finance has amounted to almost $2 billion in transactions supported so far this year from the ADB’s Trade & Supply Chain Finance Program. Those deals have included 100 medical-supply transactions, such as for test kits, medical equipment, medicine and other goods, worth $35 million and 520 food-security and agriculture-related transactions valued at $455 million. \nWe were already working to promote the digitization of trade finance before the pandemic, along with other international organizations and the private sector. The crisis has underlined the importance of those efforts. \nWe were already working to promote the digitization of trade finance before the pandemic, along with other international organizations and the private sector. The crisis has underlined the importance of those efforts. \nHad this pandemic occurred even three years ago, the situation would have been much worse. In just a short time, the move toward digitization has gained pace and advanced far enough that a full-on disaster—banks not being able to function during lockdown—has been avoided. It has been inspiring to see people rising to the challenge that they now face. Compared with the financial crisis 12 years ago, the amount of coordination and oversight in trade finance today means problems can be spotted and attended to much more quickly. \nStill, we need to drive digitization through all component parts of the ecosystem: from exporters and suppliers to shipping, ports, customs, warehousing, finance, transport, buyers and importers. And interoperability between these component parts is required to realize seamless digital trade and supply chains. \nIt now looks unlikely that this will be a short and sharp crisis followed by a quick return to normal. But if it is properly handled, the financial system can use the experience as an opportunity to enact necessary changes—and not just as an exercise in crisis management. \nFirst of all, the ADB has been working with partners to promote digitization through online learning and certifications and to advance the global adoption of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), so that everyone agrees on a common method to easily identify the players involved. The LEI is a 20-digit, alphanumeric code based on an ISO standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The Global LEI Index provides open, standardized and high-quality legal-entity reference data. Countries without an ID (identity document) system don’t need to create one. Governments can simply encourage, or require through legislation, companies to acquire LEIs. Countries that currently have ID systems should consider mapping these to LEIs for global harmonization. \nGlobal trade would benefit in a big way from having a single, trusted global entity that could verify the identities of companies that banks finance— showing who is who, and who owns whom, and what each owns. \nSecondly, the model digitization laws proposed by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) need to be adopted globally. Global adoption of these model laws will render digital commercial documents legally enforceable. Without these laws, digitization will not advance materially. It has been coming anyway, but it needs to come faster. \nThirdly, to drive the interoperability of systems to create seamless digital trade, we are working with the International Chamber of Commerce and Government of Singapore to create digital standards and protocols. This important initiative will need to involve all component parts of the trade and supply-chain ecosystem: buyers and sellers, ports, customs, shipping, logistics and finance. \nGoing forward, close coordination will be key. Now that we are beginning to see the scale of the problems we face, the entire trade and supply-chain ecosystem needs to lift its digital game. Fixes are needed so that global trade can continue to be an engine of growth and employment for everyone. Implementing those fixes is important, but the weaknesses exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic should not be used as an excuse to give up on globalization. We need to continue striving to make it better, stronger. \nThe crisis has shown how closely we are connected. Firming up those connections means growth and prosperity can continue once the pandemic is over. \nSteven Beck is ADB's Head of Trade and Supply Chain Finance Program .

A multilateral, not-for-profit development bank, ADB assists its developing member countries by providing loans, technical assistance, grants, and equity investments to promote social and economic development. Established in 1966, ADB is owned by 68 members—49 from the region. \nIndonesia is one of ADB's founding members and its sixth largest shareholder. Despite remarkable development progress, Indonesia faces substantial challenges in fostering inclusive and sustainable development. Now with COVID-19 severely affecting Indonesia, ADB estimates that poverty could increase significantly unless adequate support measures can be effectively be implemented. \nTo find out how ADB has been responding to the COVID-19 crisis in Indonesia, MVB’s Chairman Alistair Speirs talked to ADB’s Country Director for Indonesia Winfried Wicklein who has been based in Jakarta since 2017. \nFrom the onset of the outbreak, ADB has supported Indonesia’s response to the pandemic, often partnering with other agencies. \nFor example, we worked closely with UNICEF to help the Ministry of Health procure medical equipment to protect frontline workers. \nIndonesia was one of the first countries to access ADB’s counter-cyclical finance facility, providing critical budget support to the Government to help address the pandemic’s fiscal, health, and social impacts. In addition to ADB’s financial support, the facility mobilized significant finance for Indonesia from other bilateral and multilateral sources. \nIn social protection, we have partnered with other aid agencies to help the government rapidly expand social assistance programs and disburse emergency cash and food assistance. \nADB’s country partnership strategy for Indonesia is closely linked to the SDGs. Essentially, all of our projects support the SDGs. We provide targeted knowledge solutions and mobilize financing for the SDGs. We also helped the government prepare its SDG roadmap. \nCOVID-19 has highlighted the need and urgency to focus on the SDGs. In fact, the SDGs have never been more relevant and important. Post-pandemic recovery efforts must focus on the SDGs. \nADB is strongly promoting renewable energy in Indonesia. As a matter of fact, we have been involved in the financing of 25% of installed solar capacity, 50% wind and 25% of geothermal power in the country. Recently, we committed $300 million to support the expansion of geothermal power plants in West and Central Java. \nIn rural development and food security, we are financing the development of irrigation systems. We supported initiatives to help river-based communities in Banten and Maluku better manage and mitigate flood risks in several river basins. \nIn addition, we are assisting local governments in improving sanitation in urban areas such as Makassar, Yogyakarta, and Medan. In South Tangerang, we are helping the government with the structuring and tendering of a waste-to-energy project to the private sector. \nADB is also providing innovative financing solutions to mobilize private and public investments in support of the SDGs. For example, ADB is supporting a green finance facility as part of the Government’s “SDG Indonesia One” initiative. The facility is designed to help reduce the private sector’s risk in investing in green projects and provide innovative financing solutions to catalyze green investments. \nAddressing climate risk and promoting environmental sustainability are priorities in ADB’s work in Indonesia. \nWe embed climate change mitigation and adaptation measures in all ADB-financed infrastructure investments. ADB also helps mobilize domestic and international climate finance and establish market-based carbon mechanisms. \nCOVID-19 has highlighted the potentially devastating impact of climate change-related disasters. It has also been a wake-up call to switch to a greener, sustainable future. In order to “build back greener,” environmental sustainability should be a key consideration of the COVID-19 recovery strategy. \nAs mentioned earlier, we are helping Indonesia realize its geothermal potential, as well as the large-scale use of its considerable solar photovoltaic and wind resources. That is in support of Indonesia’s goal that 23% of the country’s energy supply will come from renewable sources by 2025. \nWe are working with a wide range of stakeholders to improve ocean health by catalyzing  financing and exploring innovative approaches such as coral reef insurance. We also support waste management and low-emission transport schemes, as well as Indonesia’s National Plastic Action Partnership. \nCOVID-19 has highlighted the potentially devastating impact of climate change-related disasters. It has also been a wake-up call to switch to a greener, sustainable future. In order to “build back greener,” environmental sustainability should be a key consideration of the COVID-19 recovery strategy. \nCOVID-19 has severely worsened the global economic outlook, and Indonesia is no exception. Governments around the world are facing the dual challenge of flattening the pandemic curve while addressing the economic shock. \nThere is increasing evidence that low-carbon and resilient development – for example, investments in clean physical infrastructure, energy efficiency, natural capital, and rural resilience building – can boost economic growth during the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe there is an opportunity for Indonesia to simultaneously support economic recovery while working toward meeting its ambitious targets in climate change and environmental sustainability.  ADB will support Indonesia in seizing such opportunities through knowledge and innovative financing solutions. \nCOVID-19 has had a significant impact on the Indonesian economy and the livelihoods of many Indonesians, especially the most vulnerable segments of society, namely the poor, the near-poor, the informal workers, and women and girls. Unfortunately, it is quite likely that the pandemic will undo years of remarkable progress Indonesia had made in reducing poverty in the past couple of decades. \nThe government’s macroeconomic and fiscal response, including support for expanded social assistance and businesses, has been timely and relatively effective. It will be critical to bring the pandemic under control to stimulate economic activity, investment, and job growth. ADB is supporting the government’s monitoring of the economic recovery program, as well as knowledge support in epidemiological modelling and policy recommendations for COVID-19 responses. \nNo doubt, COVID-19 should be used as an opportunity to address Indonesia’s outstanding reform agenda. If anything, COVID-19 has accentuated some of the underlying impediments to Indonesia’s longer-term growth potential. Economic recovery measures should be designed with the transformation of the economy in mind. \nI see three areas that, if addressed with determination, will help Indonesia emerge from the crisis stronger: \nFirst, investing in its people, including health, education, social protection, is critical to the foundation of a modern and resilient economy. \nSecond, prioritizing structural reforms, investment climate, domestic resource mobilization, and quality infrastructure will lead to more investment and jobs. \nThird, addressing climate and disaster risk and promoting environmental sustainability will help ensure the sustainability of Indonesia’s development. \nFocusing development efforts on these areas will help Indonesia emerge stronger from COVID-19, toward a future that is more inclusive, resilient and sustainable. \nThis is republished from Leaders e-Magazine .

The crisis immediately put a squeeze on health and medical resources around the world, particularly here in Asia and the Pacific. Among the most immediate priorities was the procurement and dispersal of medical supplies and protective equipment, such as ventilators, thermal scanners, and masks. As the region’s biggest source of development financing, the Asian Development Bank had the financial resources for these supplies and an understanding of the level of need in each of our developing members—but ADB knew there were other organizations with stronger technical, legal, and logistical expertise to obtain and deliver these supplies. That led to a partnership between ADB and UNICEF which, in a very short time, is delivering some $18 million of critical supplies to more than two dozen countries—and playing an important role in limiting the spread and impact of this deadly pandemic in our region. \nHere’s how the partnership between ADB and UNICEF came to be, the obstacles it overcame, and the impact already being felt in our member countries. \nPatrick Osewe, ADB Health Sector Chief , Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department: \nIn early January, we started hearing of a new virus circulating in People’s Republic of China (PRC) and by the end of January we realized there was something wrong. The WHO (World Health Organization) declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and we were starting to see it spread beyond PRC to Republic of Korea. So ADB determined that we needed to support our developing member countries (DMCs). And based on our discussions with the WHO, it affirmed that the capacity of a lot of our DMCs may not be strong  enough to respond to such a rapidly spreading pandemic. \nI'm an epidemiologist, I used to work at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Bank where I worked a lot on epidemics and pandemics. Over the past 20 years, we’ve had pandemics like SARS and H1N1 but you can’t compare them to COVID-19, this is more like the Spanish Flu of 1918. It’s a massive outbreak that needed a global lockdown. And because of the rapid spread, the demand for medical supplies, not just PPE (personal protective equipment) but ventilators and other supplies as well, was massive. \nIn February, ADB allocated $2 million for countries to source protective equipment, which was followed by another $2 million in March, $44 million in April, and $300,000 in June for a total of $48.3 million. ADB offered developing members a choice: procure the supplies themselves, allow ADB to procure them, or allow ADB to work with a third party. \nEduardo Banzon, ADB Principal Health Specialist, Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department: \nWe actually have formal Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with UNICEF and UNDP which allows us to transfer funds to either agency. But UNDP does not procure, UNDP does not engage countries at the same level as UNICEF and we had worked with UNICEF after the floods in Nepal in 2008. We signed the MOU with UNICEF in 2018 and then there were two specific projects: maternal and newborn health in Tajikistan and a vaccines program in the Pacific. \nNalinee Nippita, Regional Lead Partnerships, UNICEF East Asia and the Pacific: \nI was one of the authors of the 2018 MOU, so I followed it very closely and I was just happy to see it come to life. I spent seven years in New York, working with the World Bank and other MDBs precisely on this kind of engagement and ADB has always been on the agenda in terms of: how can we help influence the financing that ADB brings into our countries to help children and the vulnerable? \nWorking from the terms of the 2018 MOU, ADB met with UNICEF to discuss how it could procure medical supplies for developing members in Asia and the Pacific. \nNalinee Nippita, Regional Lead Partnerships, UNICEF East Asia and the Pacific: \nUNICEF is a big procurer of supplies so we're able to shape the market by bringing prices down because we buy for the entire world. We were not actually the lead procurer initially, I think, of PPE. But eventually UNICEF was designated as the lead procurer of PPE supplies for the UN and our partners. And again, when UNICEF procures, we always follow the WHO standard in terms of the specifications and quality control. So, if a government tells us “we want this, we want that,” we check that it's up to the standards of the WHO. It's not just procuring out of the blue anything that a government wants. And because we have a presence in every country, we also work with the Ministry of Health (MOH) on a daily basis and that helps us avoid any duplication. We also work with other partners at the country level including Non-Governmental Organizations and CSOs. We already have that capacity so, in a way, it was opportune that ADB and UNICEF connected, and we were able to support the essential medical COVID-19 supplies that were needed. \nWith financing from ADB, UNICEF began procuring medical supplies and equipment—from manufacturers domestically to meet the urgent need of some countries and then through manufacturers in countries like PRC for larger orders. \nEduardo Banzon ADB Principal Health Specialist, Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department: \nWe advised the social sector directors in our regional departments to reach out to the Ministries of Health in their countries. We wanted to make sure that we were actually responding to what the governments needed and what the governments should really need. At the same time, the countries that had the most immediate needs were the ones that really reached out to us. So Bhutan, Pakistan, India, Armenia, Kyrgyz Republic, and Sri Lanka. And UNICEF handled the logistical side of things. \nNalinee Nippita, Regional Lead Partnerships, UNICEF East Asia and the Pacific: \nGovernments are very busy; they have a lot on their hands. So, we're able to provide support in terms of procurement and logistics to get essential supplies into the country. And at the same time, provide the in-country distribution, training, and monitoring to make sure that these supplies get to frontline workers, the communities, and healthcare facilities. \nDai-Ling Chen, ADB Young Professional, Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department : \nSoon after we signed the first administrative arrangement with UNICEF, I think two weeks later, the first batch of goods had already arrived in Sri Lanka. \nTo date, the partnership between ADB and UNICEF is helping to deliver $18 million in emergency health and medical supplies to 26 DMCs: Armenia, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Cook Islands, Fiji, India, Kiribati, Kyrgyz Republic, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Myanmar, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Nepal, Niue, Pakistan, Palau, Samoa, Sri Lanka, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, Uzbekistan, and Vanuatu. \nEduardo Banzon, ADB Principal Health Specialist, Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department: \nWe wanted to respond rapidly to the needs of our DMCs and working with UNICEF allowed us to do that. We wanted to make sure that our response was an appropriate response. That we weren’t imposing something that a country doesn’t want or did not ask for. Nor were we just responding to a country with whatever they wanted without it being vetted. So we wanted to make sure it was an appropriate, efficient response and working with UNICEF allowed us to do that. And working with UNICEF gives us a better chance to make sure that this is sustainable support. So it's not just “here's the goods, buh-bye” but hopefully, this becomes more than that. \nNalinee Nippita, Regional Lead Partnerships, UNICEF East Asia and the Pacific: \nI think it's about going back to what a partnership really is all about. Using each other's strengths and comparative advantages and our teamwork on the ground. We have the same clients but we're coming at it from different angles. And if we can join up at the country level, that's where the magic happens. \nI think my colleagues on the ground who are impacted on the front line with MOH, the health workers, including trash collectors and everybody who's using PPEs, test kits, ventilators, and thermal scanners, at the moment they can say that this partnership is helping. \nPatrick Osewe, ADB Health Sector Chief, Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department: \nCOVID-19 took us by surprise because it’s more devastating than any pandemic we’ve seen in 100 years. It’s hard to convey the magnitude and the devastation. Nobody really expected that the virus was this infectious, that the virus could spread around the world so fast and swamp hospital systems as much as it did. This is going to be a long fight, probably with many setbacks. But the partnership between ADB and UNICEF has helped build confidence that although this is a virus, a bad virus, it’s one we can fight and manage together. I just want to emphasize that we're making a difference. A little one, but we’re making a difference. \n"},

Local norms for the product are taken into account in the approval process, for example ensuring acceptance by appropriate government authorities (such as United States Food and Drug Administration). In the case of new suppliers, IDA also performs due diligence as in non-emergency situations. This emergency approval is valid for 6 months, then the approval is reassessed. This has allowed for the efficient and effective approval of PPE products, guaranteeing constant availability of the requested COVID-19-related supplies from a broad range of quality-assured manufacturers. \nADB’s Procurement, Portfolio and Financial Management Department (PPFD) is working closely with IDA Foundation to collectively assess and address these issues, while relying extensively on its quality assurance and control procedures to ensure the right products are delivered to frontline health workers. \nPPFD Principal Procurement Specialist Jesper Pedersen commented: “The best practice for supply chain responsiveness and resiliency is to perform key aspects of quality assurance upfront to ensure parties involved in the manufacture of goods adhere to the applicable national or international standards of the items being produced. Quality control is then handled upon physical inspection of the goods to ensure the delivered items meet the agreed standards.  This is exactly what we have seen so far in our relationship with IDA – the right goods, delivered at the right time, and to the agreed standard.” \nThis procurement effort is part of the $48.3 million Technical Assistance (TA) on Regional Support to Address the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019, mobilized by the Health Sector Group of ADB’s Sustainable Development and Climate Change  Department. \nAs of mid-July 2020, ADB, under the TA, has procured and awarded contracts worth $15 million with various suppliers of PPEs, testing kits, diagnostics equipment, lab reagents, and other critical items to fight the disease. This is in addition to the $18 million of procurement services being undertaken by UNICEF through the same TA. \n"},

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been responding to the crisis from its early stages, focusing on a broad set of challenges related to the public health emergency, its economic fallout, and the path to recovery. \nBeginning in February 2020, emergency assistance grants helped to ensure the supply of essential medicines and personal protective equipment. A $20 billion comprehensive response package announced in April 2020 is providing substantial ongoing support through finance, knowledge, and partnerships to address the immediate and long-term impacts of COVID-19. \nWith government revenues strained due to sharp declines in economic activity, ADB has made large-scale financing available through a budget support instrument originally developed in response to the global economic crisis in 2008. \nThe financing will support policies and expenditures that extend social assistance, protection for economically vulnerable groups, resources for COVID-19 containment and prevention, and relief to affected workers and small businesses. \nIn the first three months of the COVID-19 outbreaks, over $5 billion in financing has helped to alleviate the fiscal strain in several developing member countries—including India , Indonesia , and the Philippines , which received loans of $1.5 billion each; Bangladesh ($500 million loan); Bhutan , ($20 million loan); the Kyrgyz Republic ($50 million loan and grant package); and Mongolia ($100 million loan). \nFinancing for country responses to COVID-19 extends beyond budget support. \nNew and expanded forms of assistance are reaching countries as they obtain medical supplies and equipment, upgrade health systems, and provide emergency cash subsidies to vulnerable households. New loans are being extended to Bangladesh ( $100 million loan ), Pakistan ( $300 million loan ), and the Philippines ( $200 million loan ). An ongoing health sector project in Mongolia is receiving an extra $30 million to support COVID-19 preparedness and response, along with other resources. \nIn combination with financing from loans, grants are helping countries update their pandemic response plans, assess health system and economic impacts, improve regional coordination to tackle outbreaks, and build long-lasting systems to address communicable diseases. \n$78 million in grants to 40 countries across Asia and the Pacific were approved for this within three months. \nIn the Pacific, technical assistance and other grants are providing support for COVID-19 response in the Solomon Islands , the Marshall Islands , Samoa , and Tonga . A disaster-contingent financing loan is also supporting Palau ’s response. \nQuickly disbursing grants for disaster response are enabling countries to meet immediate expenses related to the pandemic. 10 countries received a total of $11.5 million in these grants by the end of April 2020. \nPakistan, which received $2 million from the disaster response fund, is also being supported through $50 million in underutilized disaster response resources that have been reprogrammed to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic , in addition to the new emergency assistance loan of $300 million. \nAfghanistan is receiving a $40 million emergency assistance grant to address critical health system needs. \nADB is coordinating closely with member countries and international partners, including the World Bank and other multilateral development banks, the International Monetary Fund, bilateral agencies, the World Health Organization, and the United Nations Children’s Fund. This coordination has increased the available resources for ADB’s response and avoided duplication in the support provided by partners. \nCofinancing from international partners for COVID-19 response is expected to reach at least $5.8 billion. \nMember countries are making $165 million in additional grant financing available to complement ADB’s operations, including $150 million from the Government of Japan to help ADB strengthen the capacity of developing member countries to contain the spread of COVID-19. \n$4 million of the $44 million ADB has allocated for technical assistance is cofinanced by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of Korea. \nADB’s private sector assistance includes a focus on rejuvenating trade and supply chains and helping liquidity-starved small and medium-sized enterprises, including those run by female entrepreneurs. \n$475 million in financing to the private sector was approved by early May 2020, including $142 million in cofinancing. \nIn all, $2 billion of the $20 billion ADB COVID-19 comprehensive response package will provide support to the private sector. $200 million focuses on strained supply chains , with financing for private sector companies that manufacture and distribute medicines and other items needed to combat COVID-19. \nRapid funding to the private sector enabled the continued supply of essential medicines and personal protective equipment , along with natural and liquefied petroleum gas deliveries to households, hospitals, industry, and services in Wuhan and other affected areas in Hubei province, PRC in the weeks following the outbreak there. \nADB is also providing knowledge to improve country response and policymaking. \nThe Asian Development Outlook (ADO) 2020 contained a special section on the likely economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the economies of developing Asia. The data from the report and an updated assessment—which projects global losses of up to $8.8 trillion —are publicly available. \nA policy database focuses on key economic and noneconomic measure s that governments are taking to address the COVID-19 crisis to help countries assess approaches for different situations. \nFocusing on the private sector, ADB released a supply chain tracking tool to assist banks, investors, and governments with information on supply chains for the manufacture of goods critical to fighting COVID-19, such as ventilators and masks. \nAdding to the expertise offered to countries through operational projects, ADB has been sharing insights and practical knowledge from ADB experts and the wider community of development practitioners , academics, and policymakers on a range of critical challenges raised by the COVID-19. \nADB’s COVID-19 response also aims to reach local communities in need of immediate assistance, and to inspire digital innovators to tackle the longer-term challenges from the pandemic. \nIn partnership with the Philippine government and private sector partners, a food program in Metro Manila, Philippines (where ADB is headquartered) and surrounding provinces delivered critical food supplies to 162,000 vulnerable households suffering from lost income and access to food and supplies during a two month-long community-wide quarantine. \nThe program, which received additional support from individual donors including many ADB staff, offers a model that can be replicated in other countries confronting similar issues. \nADB is co-hosting a virtual challenge to crowdsource ideas and digital solutions that can help countries in Asia and the Pacific deal with the medium- and long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Promising solutions will be pilot tested throughout 2020. \nThis mobilization of financial resources, expertise, and coordination capacity reflects ADB’s institutional commitment to supporting the long-term development of Asia and the Pacific. \nThrough large-scale support for economies in developing Asia, contributions to global knowledge, and relief at the local level, ADB aims to empower governments, businesses, communities, and innovators to confront and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic as swiftly as possible. \n"},

PSDI is holistic, demand-driven, and 14 years on its approach is still working and very much wanted”, said Terry Reid, International Business Law Expert and one of the founding team members of PSDI. \nPSDI is a regional technical assistance program undertaken in partnership with the Government of Australia, the Government of New Zealand, and the Asian Development Bank. \nSince 2007, PSDI has helped alleviate poverty and promote economic growth in ADB’s 14 Pacific developing member countries through reforms that reduce the constraints to doing business and promote inclusive growth, entrepreneurship, and new business models. \nFrom PSDI’s inception, the support of the Government of Australia and New Zealand’s support since 2013 has enabled PSDI to assist the Pacific with more than 300 reforms. \nThe overall goal of PSDI is to reduce unnecessary costs of doing business in the Pacific and enable private sectors to formalize and grow, which creates jobs, increases tax revenues, and lifts people out of poverty. \nTo achieve this, PSDI helps Pacific countries address the problems outlined above through its five focus areas, which: modernize business laws, develop better financial markets and services that increase access to finance, reform state-owned enterprises and pursue public-private partnerships, establish effective competition and consumer protection frameworks, and advance the economic empowerment of women. \nA series of reforms to business and competition laws, lending, and state-owned enterprises delivered permanent benefits to the Solomon Islands economy. \nThe launch of the Pacific’s first online business registry, the Company Haus 10 years ago, made business formalization much cheaper and faster. Assistant Registrar of Companies, Veronica Manedika, has worked at the Solomon Islands Business Registry from the beginning and says, “the Company Haus has made it easier to conduct business here. When we went online, suddenly businesses could be incorporated in just an hour, instead of waiting weeks to do that.” Since the new Companies’ Act became effective in 2010, nearly 4900 new companies have registered with the Company Haus. \nThe new Companies Act made it possible for community groups to form companies and for women to register as sole traders-encouraging more women to be involved in business. \nAnother key to PSDI’s effectiveness and longevity is its unique structure, which allows it to respond quickly and provide assistance to Pacific governments' requests, working through its team of experts. \n“PSDI is flexible and fast,” says Lotte Schou-Zibell, Regional Director of ADB’s Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office in Sydney. “PSDI is able to scale-up or down, pause or postpone support, should conditions require. This flexibility allows us to allocate resources where they are most needed and where the will for reform is strong.” \nThis year, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has inflicted unprecedented new economic challenges on Pacific governments. COVID-19 has closed borders, suspended international travel, and adversely affected lives and livelihoods globally. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely hit tourism, with the South Pacific economies the most affected. \nThe economic impacts of COVID-19 are widespread across the Pacific, threatening many businesses’ survival and raising unemployment across the region. Pacific governments were quick to implement emergency fiscal responses, which will increase public debt while lower economic activity will reduce public revenue, creating additional economic constraints for Pacific governments. \nBecause of PSDI’s flexible and fast structure, it was able to provide rapid assistance to the Cook Islands and Papua New Guinea governments as they worked to develop legislation to help businesses and individuals withstand the economic impacts of the pandemic. With PSDI’s support, the Cook Island Economic Response Bill was passed by Parliament in July this year and Papua New Guinea’s business response bill is anticipated to pass by the end of the year. \nIn a post-COVID-19 world, the private sector will play an important role in economic recovery. PSDI’s long-standing work will be critical to helping the private sector contribute most effectively to economic recovery when borders open and social and economic activities resume. \nDuring COVID-19, people rely on fast, reliable internet more now than ever before to pursue a range of activities that the virus prevents them from doing in person. ADB has financed some of the region’s submarine fiber-optic cables in Cook Islands, Palau, Samoa, and Tonga. \nThe Pacific’s improved internet services have enhanced the benefit of reforms supported by ADB's PSDI, according to the Cook Islands Prime Minister, Mark Brown. \n“We are very appreciative of the private sector development initiative. They have been tremendous in assisting us with the legal work needed to implement and commission our submarine cable project. PSDI also gave us some great advice on shipping services. The speed of response, the timeliness, the effectiveness of their work has been very, very good.” \nWith requests for its support continuing to grow, PSDI has been extended to 2024 with increased funding and an expanded scope—thanks in part to the Government of Australia’s increased support for PSDI's work in Papua New Guinea through the PNG Australia Partnership. PSDI’s expanded scope in Papua New Guinea includes: Developing a world-class new, online business registry, support for a significant reform program to improve the management and performance of PNG’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs), continued work to increase the availability of finance for PNG businesses including through the development of innovative financing products, and implementing the new National Competition Policy. \nPSDI achievements: \n"},

It was held through online conference platform taking into account restrictions against group events. The ongoing pandemic will not stop NRM from undertaking one of the most important activities in ADB’s project management cycle. \nSince 1966, ADB has provided almost $6 billion in financial and technical assistance to Nepal. This included awarding, 10,700 contracts worth $2.26 billion to contractors and suppliers and 2,237 contracts worth $195.03 million to consultants. It is very important, therefore, to ensure quality private sector proposals for ADB-financed projects for better performance and results. \nFrom the perspectives of the private sector and other participants, BOS has been useful as it: \nAt the BOS, ADB explains about ADB’s operational cycle from the identification of a pipeline project through to project completion, and the types of opportunities to contractors and consultants throughout this cycle. The presentations include practical tips on how to find information using ADB’s Business Opportunities webpage on potential opportunities at each stage in the process. \nThe seminar has become popular among the business community in the country and is attended by over 200 participants every year consisting of members and representatives including the Federation of Contractors’ Association of Nepal (FCAN), Youth Community for Nepalese Contractors (YCNC), Society of Consulting Architectural and Engineering Firms (SCAEF), and Confederation of Nepalese Industries (CNI), among others. Moreover, foreign contractors working in Nepal were also invited. \n“We take into account several factors before deciding on business opportunities and having detailed information about such opportunities is a necessary first step. This allows us to set aside some resources and prepare a responsive bid within specified time,” says Ramesh Sharma, Past President of Federation of Contractors’ Association of Nepal (FCAN).  “In the past, we had to wait for invitation for bids and had to purchase the bidding documents to even get basic information such as general qualification criteria, etc. Now we get to interact with ADB procurement specialists in person and get responses to our specific queries there and then,” adds Mr. Sharma. \nFor ADB it provides an opportunity to learn from the private sector, to share, seek feedback and support for policy and practical reforms. The constructive feedback received at BOS was used when changing the overall procurement and bidding documents. \nIn 2013, an action plan was prepared by ADB Nepal to mitigate procurement, financial management, and contract management risks of ADB-funded projects. The action plan focused on improving procurement management which included, among others, promoting larger packages; rolling out of e-GP system;  and improved due diligence on syndicated bidding, The action plan identified issues like limited effectiveness of pre-bid meeting, lack of compliance by bid evaluation committee, incomplete bid submission, ghost Joint Venture partners, and bidders’ rate substantially lower than the Engineer’s estimate. These issues were also discussed during the BOS, including how the proposed changes would improve quality of proposals, quality of the procurement process, and quality of implementation. \nIn 2016, the Country and Sector Procurement Risk Assessment report was prepared to improve procurement performance and project delivery, also to assess the results of the 2013 action plan. As a result, ADB Nepal started working on adjustment of bidding documents. The risk assessment provided recommendations on the adequacy of technical proposals, meaningful participation of foreign contractors and major partners in case of joint venture (JV) during implementation (minimizing ghost contractors), and specifying the experience requirement of contracts of similar size and nature contracts. The points made during the BOS by private sector participants were used to finalize the recommendations of the risk assessment and subsequently, requests for proposals have been adjusted to reflect the ground realities. For example: mentioning of floor salaries for national experts has helped to minimize turnover of national experts. During the BOS private sector also provided feedback on these changes, and subsequently, adjustments were made. \nADB’s new procurement framework (NPF) , approved in April 2017, adopted a risk-based procurement and fit-for-purpose arrangements that opened an avenue for a customized approach entailing transaction-specific methods and documents.  During subsequent BOS held in Kathmandu, contractors and consultants had been informed about the continuous adjustments in bidding documents and request for proposals. \n“BOS organized by ADB is very useful to get updates on ADB’s procurement policy and procedures in addition to information on the opportunities under ADB funded projects. With the concept of “salary floor”, it is expected that there will be a minimal turnover of the key national experts. We view the BOS as a means of ADB’s collaboration with the private sector,” Said Mr. Tuk Lal Adhikari, President of SCAEF. \nADB and the World Bank have jointly supported the preparation of the Public Procurement Act and accompanying regulations in Nepal. ADB and WB actively supported procurement reforms, capacity building, strengthening of the Public Procurement Monitoring Office (PPMO, a public procurement regulator), and the successful rolling out of an e-GP system. \nNRM and WB in Nepal agreed in 2019 to organize BOS jointly for enhancing collaboration with the private sector and resolving issues in the construction industry and consulting services by working closely with relevant government agencies.  With the joint efforts of the two MDBs, issues related to procurement and contract management may be resolved in a timely manner. \nThe market analysis based on opportunities from local and international market and close collaboration between market players is pivotal for achieving quality of output and value for money. Streamlined procurement management based on market knowledge is a pre-requisite for increasing disbursement, improving portfolio performance of ADB in Nepal, and ultimately leading to higher net resource transfer to the country. \nThis article is written by Narendra Chand, Senior Procurement Officer, ADB Nepal Resident Mission.

CAREC主要走廊上的铁路货运总成本正在逐步下降 \nCAREC六条主要交通走廊上的铁路货运平均总成本已经从2014年的每单位1,300多美元稳步下降到2019年的800多美元，降幅近40%。然而，CAREC 6号走廊的平均货运成本仍居高不下——该走廊主要支持中南亚经济体与高加索、中东及俄罗斯联邦之间的区域间过境贸易。 \n4. CAREC主要走廊的公路运输总成本也有所下降 \n自2013年以来，在CAREC 4号走廊长达500公里的延伸路段，单位货物的平均运输成本总额下降了40%以上，由1,536美元降至2019年的900美元左右。这主要源于2018年至2019年蒙古国苏赫巴托—乌兰巴托—扎门乌德公路的平均货运价格大幅下降，而蒙古国也受益于亚行和其他国际组织支持的一项大型公路修复项目。相比而言，由于海拔高、线路偏远，中国喀什与巴基斯坦苏斯特之间约500公里长的延伸路段成为2019年公路货运成本最高的走廊路段。 \n5. 然而，中亚地区的跨境公路货运耗时更长 \n通过公路运输货物过境所需的时间逐渐增加，从2009年的6小时左右翻番至2019年的12小时以上。主要原因在于乌兹别克斯坦、哈萨克斯坦和土库曼斯坦之间的主要边境检查站存在延误。 \n第五点表明，成就与挑战并存。报告指出，海关管制、边境安全、移民程序、载重或车辆检查已成为寻租的热点领域，例如，一些官员要求支付超出官方规定金额的款项以“加快”流程。 \n有些CAREC成员国要求外国登记的货车在边境停留，并将入境货物转移到本国登记的货车上。在欧盟，货车、货物和人员只需办理极简单的过境手续即可通行；而某些CAREC成员国的这种强制转运使得货运成本和复杂性增加，尤其是在集装箱运输数量较少的情况下。 \n然而，只要各成员国共同努力，调整其监管法规，这一情况便有望迅速改善。2019年9月，巴基斯坦和阿富汗执行了一项协议，双方将24小时全天候开放位于托克汉姆的阿巴边境口岸——这条货运线路的货车数量庞大，还经常临时关闭。星期五在巴基斯坦是工作日，但在阿富汗却不是。协议的作用立竿见影：2019年第四季度，巴基斯坦方面的估算过境耗时缩短了27%，而阿富汗方面则减少了41%。 \nCAREC计划将继续推动各种改革和现代化举措，以便促进CAREC区域内无缝运输，减少贸易壁垒。 \n"},

Это особенно важно в Центральной Азии, в значительной степени не имеющей выхода к морю, где автомобильный и железнодорожный транспорт представляют собой два доминирующих способа транспортировки товаров в регионе. \nИспользуя данные об отправках, собранные за последние 10 лет, новый отчет показывает изменения в скорости и стоимости перемещения товаров через границы и по шести приоритетным транспортным коридорам, пересекающим регион. Отчет по измерению и мониторингу эффективности коридоров (ИМЭК) и эмпирический инструмент, который подкрепляет его выводы, были разработаны Программой Центрально-Азиатского регионального экономического сотрудничества (ЦАРЭС) , партнерством 11 стран с целью содействия экономическому росту и развитию посредством регионального сотрудничества. \nЧленами ЦАРЭС являются Азербайджан, Афганистан, Китайская Народная Республика (КНР), Грузия, Казахстан, Кыргызская Республика, Монголия, Пакистан, Таджикистан, Туркменистан и Узбекистан. Программа поддерживается Азиатским банком развития (АБР), в штаб-квартире которого находится Секретариат ЦАРЭС в Маниле, и другими партнерами по развитию. \nВот пять вещей, которые нужно знать об изменении тенденций в эффективности автомобильного и железнодорожного транспорта в регионе. Смета расходов основана на перемещении товаров автомобильным или железнодорожным транспортом, нормированном на одну 20-тонную грузовую единицу на 500 километров (км). \n1. Транспортировка товаров через национальные границы по железной дороге становится быстрее \nПостепенно сокращается время, необходимое для перемещения товаров по железной дороге через 36 пунктов пересечения границы, изученных в отчете. В 2019 году в среднем пересечение границы по железной дороге занимало около 21 часа, что почти на 35% быстрее, чем в 2014 году. Этот показатель включает время ожидания, разгрузки и погрузки, а также время, необходимое для смены ширины колеи. Это улучшение в значительной степени связано с мерами, принятыми Китайской Народной Республикой, включая оптимизацию процессов пересечения границ и повышение перегрузочной способности - процесса передачи груза с одного вида транспорта на другой или с одной железнодорожной сети на другую железнодорожную сеть с использованием другой к ширины колеи. \n2. Скорость перевозки грузов по железной дороге за последнее десятилетие значительно выросла \nЗа последние 10 лет произошло значительное увеличение средней скорости перевозки грузов по шести основным транспортным коридорам ЦАРЭС по железной дороге. В 2019 году товары перемещались в среднем со скоростью 45 км/ч, что примерно на 67% быстрее, чем в среднем 27 км/ч в 2009 году. Эти улучшения в значительной степени связаны с более коротким средним временем пересечения границы и значительным увеличением скорости поездов Китайской железной дороги. \n3. Общая стоимость перевозки грузов по железной дороге по основным коридорам ЦАРЭС постепенно снижается \nОбщая средняя стоимость перевозки грузов по шести основным транспортным коридорам ЦАРЭС по железной дороге неуклонно снижалась с более чем 1300 долларов США за единицу в 2014 году до чуть более 800 долларов США в 2019 году - сокращение почти на 40%. Однако средние затраты на перемещение товаров по коридору ЦАРЭС 6, который обслуживает межрегиональную транзитную торговлю между странами Центральной и Южной Азии с Кавказом, Ближним Востоком и Российской Федерацией, оставались высокими. \n4. Общие затраты на автомобильные перевозки по основным коридорам ЦАРЭС также снизились \nС 2013 года общая средняя стоимость перевозки единицы товаров на 500-километровом участке коридора ЦАРЭС 4по автомобильной дороге снизилась более чем на 40%, с 1536 долларов до примерно 900 долларов в 2019 году. Это было вызвано значительным снижением средней ставки автомобильных грузоперевозок с 2018 по 2019 годы по дороге Сухэ-Батор-Улан-Батор-Замиин-Ууд в Монголии, стране, \nкоторая получила выгоду от программы восстановления дороги при поддержке АБР и других международных донорских организаций. В отличие от этого, самым дорогим участком транспортного коридора для перевозки грузов в 2019 году был участок протяженностью около 500 км между Каши в Китайской Народной Республике и Состом в Пакистане из-за большой высоты и удаленности маршрута. \n5. Тем не менее, транспортировка товаров через автомобильные границы в Центральной Азии занимает больше времени \nВремя, необходимое для перевозки товаров через национальные границы автомобильным транспортом, постепенно увеличивалось с 6 часов в 2009 году до более чем 12 часов десятилетие спустя. В основном это произошло из-за задержек на ключевых пунктах пропуска между Узбекистаном, Казахстаном и Туркменистаном. \nПятый пункт показывает, что, несмотря на прогресс, некоторые важные проблемы остаются. В отчете таможенный контроль, пограничная безопасность, иммиграционные процедуры, а также вес или досмотр транспортных средств определены в качестве горячих точек, например, некоторые официальные лица запрашивают суммы сверх установленных официальных платежей для «ускорения» процессов. \nНекоторые страны-члены ЦАРЭС требуют, чтобы грузовики с иностранной регистрацией останавливались на границе и перегружали прибывающие грузы на грузовики с местной регистрацией. В отличие от Европейского Союза, где грузовики, товары и люди могут перемещаться с минимальными пограничными формальностями, такая обязательная перегрузка увеличивает стоимость и сложность, особенно с учетом небольшого количества контейнерных перевозок. \nТем не менее, когда страны работают вместе над согласованием своих правил, это может привести к быстрым улучшениям. В сентябре 2019 года Пакистан и Афганистан подписали соглашение о введении круглосуточного режима работы на их общем пограничном переходе в Торкхаме - популярном маршруте перевозки грузов, известном большим количеством грузовиков и временными закрытиями. Пятница - рабочий день в Пакистане, но не в Афганистане. Воздействие было мгновенным: в четвертом квартале 2019 года расчетное время пересечения границы сократилось на 27% с пакистанской стороны и на 41% с афганской стороны. \nПрограмма ЦАРЭС будет продолжать продвигать инициативы по реформированию и модернизации, которые способствуют бесперебойному транспорту и сокращают торговые барьеры в регионе ЦАРЭС. \n"},

This is particularly important in largely landlocked Central Asia where road and rail represent the two dominant modes of transporting goods across the region. \nUsing data from shipments collected over the past 10 years, a new report sheds light on changes in the speed and costs of moving goods across borders and along six priority transport corridors that crisscross the region. The Corridor Performance Measurement and Monitoring (CPMM) report and empirical tool that underpins its findings were designed by the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program , a partnership for 11 countries to promote economic growth and development through regional cooperation. \nCAREC’s members are Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The program is supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which hosts the CAREC Secretariat in its headquarters in Manila, and other development partners. \nHere are five things to know about changing trends in the efficiency of road and railway transport in the region. Cost estimates are based on moving goods by road or rail normalized by one 20-ton unit of goods per 500 kilometers (km). \n1. Transporting goods over national borders using railways is getting faster \nThere has been a gradual reduction in the amount of time taken to move goods by railway through the 36 border crossing points studied in the report. The average border crossing took around 21 hours in 2019 by rail, almost 35% faster than in 2014. This measurement includes waiting, unloading, and loading time, and the time taken to change rail gauges. This improvement is largely due to measures taken by the People’s Republic of China including streamlining border-crossing processes and enhancing transloading capability—the process of transferring a shipment from one mode of transport to another or from one rail network to another rail network using a different gauge. \n2. The overall speed of transporting cargo by rail rose significantly in the past decade \nThere has been a significant increase in the average speed of transporting cargo across CAREC’s six major transport corridors by rail over the past 10 years. In 2019, goods moved at an average of 45 kms per hour (km/h), some 67% faster than the average of 27 km/h in 2009. These improvements are largely due to shorter average border-crossing times and substantial increase in China Railway’s train speed. \n3. The overall cost of transporting goods via rail along CAREC’s major corridors is gradually going down \nThe total average cost of transporting cargo along CAREC’s six major transport corridors by rail has steadily decreased from more than $1,300 per unit in 2014 to just over $800 in 2019—an almost 40% reduction. However, average costs of moving goods along CAREC corridor 6, which serves interregional transit trade between Central and South Asian economies with the Caucasus, Middle East, and the Russian Federation, remained high. \n4. Overall road transportation costs along CAREC’s major corridors have also decreased \nSince 2013, the total average cost of transporting a unit of goods along a 500-km stretch of CAREC corridor 4 via road has decreased by more than 40%, from $1,536 to around $900 in 2019. This was spurred by a substantial decrease in estimated average road freight rates from 2018 to 2019 along the Sukhbaatar–Ulaanbaatar–Zamiin-Uud road in Mongolia, a country which has benefitted from a major road rehabilitation program supported by ADB and other donor international organizations. \nBy contrast, the most expensive road corridor section for transporting goods in 2019 was the roughly 500-km stretch between Kashi in the People’s Republic of China, and Sost in Pakistan, due to the route’s high altitude and remote circuit. \n5. However, it is taking longer to transport goods across road borders in Central Asia \nThere has been a gradual rise in the amount of time taken to move goods across national borders by road, from about 6 hours in 2009, doubling to more than 12 hours a decade later. This was largely due to delays at key crossing points between Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. \nPoint five shows that despite the progress, some important challenges remain. The report identified customs controls, border security, immigration procedures, and weight or vehicle inspection as hotspots for rent-seeking behavior, such as some officials request sums above official stipulated payments to “expedite” processes. \nSome CAREC member countries require foreign-registered trucks to stop at the border and transfer inbound shipments onto locally registered trucks. Unlike the European Union where trucks, goods, and people can move with minimal border formalities, this mandatory transloading increases cost and complexity, particularly given the low number of containerized shipments. \nYet, when countries work together to align their regulations, this can result in rapid improvements. In September 2019, Pakistan and Afghanistan implemented an agreement to implement 24/7 operating hours at their common border crossing in Torkham—a popular goods transportation route notorious for its high volume of trucks and ad hoc closures. Friday is a working day in Pakistan but not in Afghanistan. The impact was instantaneous: in the fourth quarter of 2019, estimated crossing times dropped 27% on the Pakistan side, and 41% on the Afghan side. \nThe CAREC Program will continue to promote reform and modernization initiatives that foster seamless transport and reduce trade barriers within the CAREC region. \n"},

How did it overcome the challenge?", "url": "https://www.adb.org/news/features/factories-hospitals-journey-emergency-supplies-during-pandemic", "detail": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) in June 2020 was faced with the challenging task of delivering urgently needed personnel protective equipment (PPEs) to member countries in Southeast, East, Central, and West Asia, at a time when travel and transport restrictions were at their most severe. \nThe COVID-19 crisis had created capacity constraints across the supply chain, and the task of transporting these goods presented a major challenge. \nThe COVID-19 crisis had created capacity constraints across the supply chain, and the task of transporting these goods presented a major challenge. \nAs no single carrier has the right footprint across such a vast array of destinations, ADB’s Procurement, Portfolio, and Financial Management Department (PPFD) undertook market research, followed by a competitive tendering process with multiple pre-qualified international freight forwarding firms. \nThese organizations, with access to sea, road, rail, and air transport networks, were in an optimal position to assist ADB in developing an appropriate logistics strategy that addressed the delivery needs of each developing member countries’ healthcare system, while also having the breadth of resources and support platforms across the region to deliver in a timely manner. They complement this with the capacity to undertake quality assurance and control, prior to acceptance of the goods for shipment. \nKuehne+Nagel was selected as ADB’s freight forwarder for this important mission. Led by its Humanitarian Logistics Division in Copenhagen, Kuehne+Nagel performed the role of ADB’s \"Supply Chain Control Tower\"—coordinating all of the necessary inspection, consolidation, loading, and shipping services to ensure goods reach the right place at the right time.  The team in Copenhagen performed this critical role of engaging its network of country offices, agents, and subcontractors to assure quality inspections and multi-modal deliveries across this vast geography. \nAs a logistics partner for over 20 years to the United Nations, Kuehne+Nagel brought significant expertise, offering unique solutions to enable fast delivery, while also providing value for money for ADB recipients. \n\"Even in the best of times, some of the recipient destinations in Central and West Asia are challenging to reach due to their remote nature, terrain, and distance. Operating in the midst of a global pandemic makes such a job that much more difficult, yet with right planning and strategy anything is possible.\" \nFor example, being mountainous and landlocked, Afghanistan is a difficult country from a logistics perspective. These challenges have been further exacerbated by COVID-19 related border closures on traditional overland routes. Afghanistan is one of the largest recipients of goods under ADB’s $48.3 million Technical Assistance (TA) on Regional Support to Address the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019.  Kuehne+Nagel developed a multi-modal delivery solution for Afghanistan that involves ocean freight into the United Arab Emirates with reloading onto cargo planes into Kabul. \nThis \"air bridge\" leverages existing sea freight routes from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) into the Middle East, while offering fast and reliable air delivery for the final leg of the journey into Kabul. This is just one of the many ways ADB has been able to support even the most remote countries during the pandemic. \nWith recipients spread across each corner of the continent, capacity constraints in the transport sector, and a myriad of differing import requirements and protocols, flexible planning is an integral part of this successful endeavour. \nPPFD's Procurement Specialist Luke Fochtman, commented: \"Even in the best of times, some of the recipient destinations in Central and West Asia are challenging to reach due to their remote nature, terrain, and distance.  Operating in the midst of a global pandemic makes such a job that much more difficult, yet with the the right planning and strategy anything is possible.\" \n"}
