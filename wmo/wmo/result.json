There is also a need to support new technologies and the development of autonomous observing instruments”, says Dr. Anthony Rea, Director of Infrastructure at the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nIn recognition of the fundamental importance of ocean observations to the success of the Ocean Decade, Dr. Albert Fischer, Head of Ocean Observations and Services Section at the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, says, “one of the Decade Challenges is to ensure a sustainable ocean observing system that delivers timely data and information accessible to all users on the state of the ocean, across all ocean basins”.\n\nIn the current global Covid-19 pandemic, several ocean observing systems and ocean monitoring operations have been impacted, as restrictions on research vessel operations hinders the repair and replacement of measuring equipment. \n\nMonths on from the initial pandemic impacts and with research vessel operations far from returning to normal, GOOS has growing concern for parts of the global system. The global pandemic has shown that international cooperation and operational flexibility, such as contracting commercial vessels and using ships of opportunity, are crucial to sustain and maintain the global ocean observation system at sea.\n\n“As the global Covid-19 pandemic took hold, some of the ocean observing networks were impacted in surprising ways highlighting both strengths and weaknesses in the global met-ocean observing system; the pandemic has also catalyzed creativity to maintain the in situ observations and may accelerate our use of autonomous instruments and new approaches in the future”, says Dr. David Legler, Chair of the GOOS Observations Coordination Group (OCG).\n\nRecently commercial shipping and private initiatives are getting more involved in cost effective and innovative met-ocean data collection projects, in support of ocean observations. “We need a future where commercial, research, and privately owned vessels make multivariate observations, using a combination of automated and human-observed measurements, and where all data and metadata will be available to benefit users of marine information” reports the Report Card.\n\nThe 2020 Report Card also highlights the latest remarkable advances in animal-based measurements; providing data in important regions that are currently poorly covered by traditional observing platforms, greatly enhancing studies of climate variability and the delivery of information for climate prediction at global and regional scales.\n\nThe Ocean Observing System Report Card was prepared by the GOOS Observations Coordination Group together with OceanOPS.\n\nNew 5-year Strategic Plan for OceanOPS, the ocean observing system monitoring and coordination Centre\n\nThe Plan articulates five strategic goals, the objectives, and challenges to realize the vision for OceanOPS - to provide vital services in monitoring, coordinating, and integrating ocean data and metadata, across an expanding network of global oceanographic and marine meteorological observing and service communities in support of improved services and capabilities.\n\nOceanOPS core functions are to monitor and improve the performance of the Global Ocean Observing System, lead metadata harmonization, support and enhance operations, and enable new data streams. OceanOPS also addresses the strategic earth-system prediction goal of WMO by enhancing ocean data and metadata flow.\n\n\"On the strength of our experience, of our infrastructure built slowly and strategically, and following up a review process, we shaped a clear 5-year Strategic Plan, together with our stakeholders, to project our activities into the Ocean Decade. Rebranded, with a new name that both preserves the JCOMM Observing Programme Support Centre legacy and at the same time is a clearer expression of our role to the larger community, we are now rounding a new cape. We will keep focusing our eye (OPS in Greek mythology) on the GOOS and cultivate the integrated concept in all our actions\", says Mathieu Belbéoch, OceanOPS Lead.\n\nThe Ocean Observing System Report Card is available at: www.ocean-ops.org/reportcard2020 \n\nThe OceanOPS 5-year Strategic Plan (2021-2025) is available at: www.ocean-ops.org/strategy \n\n \n\nFor more information, please contact:\n\nreportcard@ocean-ops.org\n\nsupport@ocean-ops.org\n  "},

These range from public health, ecological disruption to climate change impacts. While proposing scientific solutions and policy recommendations, the forum called on the global community to accelerate green transformation in recovery.\n\nThe public health crisis unleashed by COVID-19 is causing human tragedy, social upheaval and economic turmoil across the globe. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres emphasized in the latest UN Policy Brief: COVID-19 in an Urban World: “Now is the time to rethink and reshape the urban world. Now is the moment to adapt to the reality of this and future pandemics. Now is our chance to recover better, by building more resilient, inclusive and sustainable cities.”\n\nWMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas pointed out that 4.5 billion people were affected by disasters from 1998 to 2017, and 96% of these were weather related. In addition, water stress is a global challenge that needs to be tackled urgently and systematically. Meanwhile, deterioration of air quality has been exacerbated by heatwaves and wildfires.\n\nNevertheless, there are win-win opportunities in climate mitigation, particularly through stepping up efforts in promoting electric transportation, eco-mobility and renewable energy, said Prof. Taalas.\n\nPatricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, reaffirmed the important role of multilateralism in helping cities and communities around the world make the urgently needed energy transformation.\n\n“Boosting ambition, building a more resilient future, and providing a just transition from fossil to green: those are the three key elements we need to build a cleaner, greener and healthier future. But that’s not all we need—we also need strong National Adaptation Plans to back up this work.”\n\nElizabeth Maruma Mrema, Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity, said that there is increasing clarity on the connection between the resilience of human societies to pandemics, such as COVID-19, and the way we address the combined and interlinked challenges of climate change, land degradation and biodiversity loss. We need to engage sectors that can contribute most in applying nature-based solutions to health and urban resilience.\n\nAlmost half of the world’s population, about 3.6 billion people, remains offline. Having access to accordable Internet remains a prominent challenge for many. Digital technologies and ICTs are key enablers for accelerating sustainability efforts and climate actions in cities, from enhancing operational efficiency of urban complexities and infrastructure to improving accessibility to essential services and bring the benefits of nature to all people, said Malcolm Johnson, Deputy Secretary-General of International Telecommunication Union;\n\nIn his closing remarks, Global Forum for Human Settlements Secretary-General Lu Haifeng underlined the need to kick-start green development revolution, green city revolution and green cultural revolution on a global scale.\n\nThe concluding press release is here\n\n\n \n  "},

Hardly any region has warmed as much as the Arctic over recent decades. At the same time, we lack year-round observations from the ice-covered Arctic Ocean.\n\nOn 20 September 2019 Polarstern departed from the Norwegian port of Tromsø, bound for the Central Arctic, the epicentre of climate change. Once there, the ship allowed itself to become trapped in the ice, and began a one-year-long drift across the North Pole, completely at the mercy of natural forces – the route and speed were solely determined by the ice drift, powered by wind and currents.\n\nOver the five legs of the expedition, a total of 442 researchers, Polarstern crewmembers, young investigators, teachers and members of the press took part. Seven ships, several aircraft and more than 80 institutions from 20 countries were involved.\n\nEven when, due to the coronavirus pandemic, virtually every other expedition around the globe was cancelled, thanks to the broad support of the international scientific community and to the tireless efforts of the entire team, MOSAiC was able to continue.\n\n“Climate change is the greatest challenge facing humanity. A challenge that we can only overcome together – by transcending the borders of disciplines and nations alike. The international MOSAiC mission, which brought together researchers from 20 nations, shows that, despite all the setbacks, at the international level there is a willingness to rise to this challenge. MOSAiC, the greatest Arctic expedition of all time, is an historic milestone for climate research, said Anja Karliczek, German Federal Minister of Research.\n\nProf Antje Boetius, AWI Director, said: “Today the expedition comes to a successful end, and we have a much clearer grasp of the interplay between the ice, ocean and atmosphere than ever before. The unparalleled commitment of experts from around the globe is what allowed us to make this scientific breakthrough in Arctic research. They have brought back countless samples and comprehensive data from their one-year-long drift. This unprecedented dataset is a gift for all humankind. Now it’s our responsibility to use the new knowledge gleaned to make the right choices – for the future of the Arctic, and with it, the future of our planet.”\n\n“We’ve seen how the Arctic ice is dying. In the summer, even at the North Pole, it was characterised by extensive melting and erosion. If we don’t make immediate and sweeping efforts to combat climate warming, we’ll soon see ice-free Arctic summers, which will have incalculable repercussions for our own weather and climate. Though today the Central Arctic remains a fascinating, frozen landscape in winter, the ice is only half as thick as it was 40 years ago, and the winter temperatures we encountered were nearly always ten degrees warmer than what Fridtjof Nansen experienced on his ground-breaking Arctic expedition over 125 years ago,”  said Prof Markus Rex, Expedition Leader and head of the MOSAiC project at AWI.\n\n“Arctic sea ice is not only an important part of the global climate system; it is also a unique ecosystem and the basis of life for many indigenous societies. And it is a realm of fascinating and unmatched beauty. We should do everything within our power to preserve it for future generations.”\n\nIn order to make this unique project a success and to obtain the most valuable data possible, more than 80 institutes had pooled their resources in a research consortium. The expedition budget was over 140 million euros.\n\nFurther details here \n  "},

The first nine months of 2020 were the second warmest on record (after 2016), according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n\nThe 10 warmest Septembers have all occurred since 2005. The seven warmest Septembers have occurred in the last seven years (2014-2020), continuing the long-term warming trend.\n\nThe Southern Hemisphere’s land and ocean surface temperature departure from average for September 2020 was the highest on record. Meanwhile, the Northern Hemisphere had its third-warmest September on record. Arctic sea ice extent was the second lowest on record, whilst Antarctic sea ice was above average.\n\nEarlier this month, the Copernicus Climate Change Service operated by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts also reported that it was the warmest September on record.\n\nThe latest data underline the main conclusion of the recent United in Science report, coordinated by WMO, that climate change has not stopped for COVID-19. Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are at record levels and continue to increase. Emissions are heading in the direction of pre-pandemic levels following a temporary decline caused by the lockdown and economic slowdown.\n\n“2016–2020 is set to be the warmest five-year period on record. Whilst many aspects of our lives have been disrupted in 2020, climate change has continued unabated,” said WMO Secretary-General, Professor Petteri Taalas in issuing the United in Science report. “The world is not on track to meet agreed targets to keep global temperature increase well below 2 °C or at 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.”\n\nThe Northern Hemisphere January-September land and ocean surface temperature tied with 2016 as the warmest such period since global records began in 1880, while the Southern Hemisphere had its fourth-warmest such period on record, according to NOAA.\n\nEurope, Asia and the Gulf of Mexico had their warmest January-September period on record. In northern Asia, temperatures were at least 5.4°F (3.0°C) above average. South America and the Caribbean region had a January-September temperature that ranked as the second highest on record. \n\nMeanwhile, cooler-than-average conditions were limited to Alaska, western Canada, northern India and across the southern oceans.\n\n \n  "},

IMD acts as the regional centre covering Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, providing forecast products, data and training\n\nThe South Asia FFGS is funded by the United States Agency for International Development/Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (USAID/BHA) and implemented by the World Meteorological Organization and the Hydrologic Research Center (HRC), while National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a satellite data provider into the System.\n\nIt is part of a global FFGS which currently provides early warnings to three billion people – 40% of the world’s population – across more than 60 countries.\n\nIn an inaugural address at the high-level launch, Dr. M. Rajeevan, Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences, emphasized the need for enhancing the observational network for rainfall and soil moisture to improve the performance of the system.\n\nAn automated mode of dissemination is to be established with the stakeholders along with the use of social media, so that the information reaches disaster management authorities in a timely manner. Regional and International coordination must be strengthened for exchange of data, expertise, development and sustaining the services, he said.\n\nDr. M. Mohapatra, Director-General of IMD and Permanent Representative of India with WMO, welcomed the collaborative work done in capacity building for forecasting hydro-meteorological hazards.\n\nHe said that the Guidance for flash floods in the form of Threats (6 hours in advance) and Risks (24 hours in advance) will be provided by the Regional Centre to NMHSs and State Disaster Management Authorities and other stakeholders. This will enable all member countries to issue impact-based forecasting, at watershed and also city level, of flash floods which are very sudden and of short duration. In turn, this will help reduce the loss of life and property.\n\n“Flash floods and riverine floods cause major loss of life and property in South Asia during the monsoon season. Due to the frequency of extreme precipitation, urbanization, land-use changes, the need for early warning systems becomes more important,” said Dr. Hwirin Kim, Head of WMO Hydrological and Water Resources Services Division.  \n\n“We appreciate the IMD’s strong leadership and support for the South Asia FFGS project for the mitigation of impacts of flash flooding in India and in the South Asia region. We are looking forward to working together for improving FFGS accuracy and the capacity of member countries.,” she said. \n\nSince September 2020, the IMD has started issuing regional flash flood advisories to the Member countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka) alerting NMHSs and stakeholders on possible flash flood risks and associated heavy rainfall and/or snowmelt daily with the lead time up to 36 hours. Moreover, IMD conducted an online training from 8 to 10 July 2020 for 130 forecasters from Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka.\n\n \n\n \n  "},

With ECMWF’s focus on ensemble prediction, charts also cover probability-based information, which provides a guide to forecast confidence. The likelihood of extreme conditions, as well as tropical and extratropical cyclone activity, are also included.\n\nUp to now, full access to these forecast charts was restricted to national meteorological and hydrological services of ECMWF’s Member and Co-operating States, WMO members, and commercial customers. Access was subject to a range of bespoke licences and often incurred charges for customers. Only a few charts were freely available.\n\nMaking these hundreds of charts free and open means that, not only is there no charge for the information, but users can also share, redistribute and adapt the information as they require, even for commercial applications, as long as they acknowledge the source as ECMWF. The charts are available under the Creative Commons licence (CC-BY 4.0).\n\nThe changes also mean a move to an open data policy for historical information in ECMWF’s huge data repository – the Meteorological Archival and Retrieval System, or MARS. MARS contains hundreds of petabytes of data including recent and past forecasts, analyses, climatological data and research experiments; it represents the largest archive of such data in the world. Making these MARS data open will simplify and expand their use and, importantly, allow their re-use, thus stimulating further research and the development of applications related to weather and beyond.\n\n“WMO welcomes this announcement at a time when it is reviewing its own data policy with the aim of making more data accessible to the global community. The greater availability of ECMWF data and products will be a strong incentive for greater data sharing by WMO members for global benefit,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.\n\nThe changes are part of broader developments across Europe to encourage the wider use of public sector data.\n\nRolf Brennerfelt, Chair of ECMWF Policy Advisory Committee, commented: “ECMWF Member States have been keen for the Centre’s data to be open and free for a while. The societal benefits associated with free and open data are big. We are aware that the move comes with its financial challenges, but the benefits outweigh those challenges. We are in a period of transition, and this first batch of data being made freely available is a very good start and illustrates well our commitment to this principle.”\n\nThis phased move towards free and open data aims to support creativity and innovation in the field of scientific research as well as weather applications. Whilst today’s announcement only represents a first step, it has the potential to already increase accountability and transparency, and enable more necessary and critical scientific, social and economic advances.\n\nAs part of its formal agreement with the WMO, ECMWF is designated as a World Meteorological Centre (WMC). The change in policy at ECMWF will mean simplified access to ECMWF forecasts for the national meteorological and hydrological services (NMHSs) of WMO Members. NMHS forecasters rely on WMCs for the information they need to carry out their operational activities and in particular to warn citizens of severe weather events.\n\nThese are only a few examples, but they show how much is already being achieved through free and open data, and offer a glimpse of how much more could be possible.  \n\nECMWF press release is here\n  "},

Analyses show that the hole has reached its maximum size.\n\nThe 2020 ozone hole grew rapidly from mid-August and peaked at around 24 million square kilometres in early October.  It now covers 23 million km2, above average for the last decade and spreading over most of the Antarctic continent. \n\nWMO’s Global Atmosphere Watch programme works closely with Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service, NASA, Environment and Climate Change Canada and other partners to monitor the Earth’s ozone layer, which protects us from the harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun.\n\nNASA’s Ozone Watch reports a lowest value of 95 Dobson Units recorded on October 1.  Scientists are seeing signs that the 2020 ozone hole now seems to have reached its maximum extent.\n\n“There is much variability in how far ozone hole events develop each year. The 2020 ozone hole resembles the one from 2018, which also was a quite large hole, and is definitely in the upper part of the pack of the last fifteen years or so”, Vincent-Henri Peuch, Director of Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service at ECMWF, said in a news release.\n\n“With the sunlight returning to the South Pole in the last weeks, we saw continued ozone depletion over the area. After the unusually small and short-lived ozone hole in 2019, which was driven by special meteorological conditions, we are registering a rather large one again this year, which confirms that we need to continue enforcing the Montreal Protocol banning emissions of ozone depleting chemicals.”\n\nThe Montreal Protocol bans emissions of ozone depleting chemicals. Since the ban on halocarbons, the ozone layer has slowly been recovering; the data clearly show a trend in decreasing area of the ozone hole.\n\nThe latest WMO /UN Environment Programme Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion, issued in 2018, concluded that the ozone layer on the path of recovery and to potential return of the ozone values over Antarctica to pre-1980 levels by 2060.\n\n\n\nThe large ozone hole in 2020 has beendriven by a strong, stable and cold polar vortex, which kept the temperature of the ozone layer over Antarctica consistently cold.\n\nOzone depletion is directly related to the temperature in the stratosphere, which is the layer of the atmosphere between around 10 km and round 50 km altitude. This is because polar stratospheric clouds, which have an important role in the chemical destruction of ozone, only form at temperatures below -78°C.\n\nThese polar stratospheric clouds contain ice crystals that can turn non-reactive compounds into reactive ones, which can then rapidly destroy ozone as soon as light from the sun becomes available to start the chemical reactions. This dependency on polar stratospheric clouds and solar radiation is the main reason the ozone hole is only seen in late winter/early spring.\n\nStratospheric ozone concentrations have been observed to have reduced to near-zero values over Antarctica around 20 to 25 km of altitude (50-100hPa), with the ozone layer depth coming just below 100 Dobson Units, about a third of its typical value outside of ozone hole events. \n\nDuring the Southern Hemisphere spring season (August - October) the ozone hole over the Antarctic increases in size, reaching a maximum between mid-September and mid-October. When temperatures high up in the atmosphere (stratosphere) start to rise in late Southern Hemisphere spring, ozone depletion slows, the polar vortex weakens and finally breaks down, and by the end of December ozone levels have returned to normal.\n\n \n  "},

The weather patterns associated with this low-pressure system met over the Alps with warm air coming up from the South, feeding off warm Mediterranean water which then cooled and formed a persistent stormy-rainy cell.\n\nCoinciding with this, other parts of Europe saw record temperatures.\n\nUp to 500 mm of rain, or the equivalent of 3 months, fell in the worst affected parts of the Alpes-Martimes department, according to Météo-France. The deluge swept away houses and infrastructure, cutting off entire communities and causing a number of casualties. The northern Italian province of Piedmont was also badly hit. Satellite images captured the extent of debris and mud which flowed into the ocean.\n\nThe amount of rainfall associated with this episode was totally exceptional. These are rainfall events which would normally only happen once a century. It is the second time this year that an amount of 500 mm has fallen (Gard on 19 September), according to Véronique Ducrocq,  a meteorologist with Météo-France and coordinator of a HyMeX, a WMO-related project to improve modelling of the Mediterrean's water cycle.\n\n\"It is historical. We have never seen 2 such events within one year,\" she said.\n\nAnalysis of extreme rainfall events in recent years shows has indicated an intensification of heavy rainfall and an increase in the frequency of strong Mediterranean episodes, with more than 200 mm of rainfall in 24 hours.\n\nResearch into this is continuing as modelling of extreme rainfall events remains a major challenge.\n\nDetails (in French) are here\n\n \n  "},

Its theme is “The Future we Want, the UN we Need: Reaffirming our Collective Commitment to Multilateralism.”\n\nAt the opening session of the General Assembly, Chinese President Xi Jinping raised the level of climate ambition by announcing that China would aim to become carbon neutral by 2060. The week has also seen major announcements from the European Union, as well as from companies and local authorities around the world.\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres convened a high-level Climate Change Roundtable of global leaders on 24 September  to galvanize commitment to meeting the Paris Agreement targets to keep temperature increase to between 1.5°C and 2°C.\n\n“The damage to people and the environment is immense and growing. The recent United in Science report from the World Meteorological Organization is unequivocal,” said Mr Guterres.\n\n“The past decade was the hottest on record. And concentrations of greenhouse gases have continued to rise. Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and forest fires reached an all-time high in 2019 and are 62 per cent higher than in 1990,” he said.\n\n“We must urgently reverse course. And we have less than ten years to do so,” said Mr Guterres.\n\nThe Roundtable is meant to raise the debate ahead of the Fifth Anniversary of the Paris Agreement when some governments are expected to present ambitious and quality climate plans (the Nationally Determined Contributions and the Long-Term Strategies.\n\nInvited speakers included the two governments presiding over the climate change conference of Parties (COP), President Sebastian Piñera of Chile (COP25) and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom (COP26) as well as ten Heads of State and Government from the African and Asia regions, the Small Island Developing States and the European Union and some corporate leaders. It focussed on:\n\n\n\t“Ambition on finance: keeping the commitments and ensuring more financial flows, public and private, are aligned with the needs for decarbonization of the economy, protection of people and resilience of infrastructures.”\n\t“Aligning climate plans (NDCs and LTSs), recovery/stimulus plans and business plans with 1.5C and climate neutrality”.\n\t“Protecting people and planet to ensure a sustainable and just recovery: adaptation and resilience”.\n\n\nThe Roundtable heard plans for a global event on 12 December, the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement, this year to rally much greater climate action and ambition.\n\nNational governments will be invited to present more ambitious and high-quality climate plans (the Nationally Determined Contributions – NDCs – and Long-Term Strategies), as well as COVID recovery plans, new finance commitments and measures to build resilience that are aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5°C and the driving forward the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nOn 23 September, a Climate Action Event at SDG Action Zone organized by UN Climate Change highlighted stories of people creating change – and explain how everyone can become part of the solution.\n\n“If we fail with climate change mitigation we will see more dramatic things than we have seen because of COVID-19. The failure of climate mitigation would see challenges which would last hundreds of years,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas in a video message during a debate on the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n“We have to adapt to climate change and one very powerful way to adapt to climate change is to invest in early warning services. By doing so we can also give a boost to the implementation of SDGs and we can avoid both human losses and economic losses relating to disasters,” he said.\n\nTo mark its 75th anniversary, the United Nations launched “a global conversation” in January using surveys and polls to find out what all kinds of people were thinking about the future. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called the results “striking:”\n\n“People are thinking big — about transforming the global economy, accelerating the transition to zero carbon, ensuring universal health coverage, ending racial injustice and ensure that decision-making is more open and inclusive,” he said. “And people are also expressing an intense yearning for international cooperation and global solidarity.”\n\n \n\n \n  "},

The virtual ceremony is taking place during the week-long Executive Council Meeting of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) from September 28 to October 2 2020.\n\nThe Alliance brings together major international development, humanitarian and climate finance institutions to scale up and unite efforts to improve weather, climate, hydrological and related environmental information services, also known as hydromet services. Improving forecasts, warnings and projections of climate emergencies will save countless livelihoods and lives. One priority action of the Alliance is to establish the Systematic Observations Financing Facility (SOFF) to sustain compliance of developing countries with the Global Basic Observing Network and increase their access to improved weather and climate products and services.  \n\nThe CIF brings significant expertise and experience to this partnership through its Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR). This Program has supported some of the most vulnerable countries in the world to improve their capacity in providing reliable hydromet services, including Dominica, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Papua New Guinea, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Tajikistan.\n\nWith total funding of more than $300 million, including co-financing, these investments cover all five components of the hydromet value chain: observation and monitoring; data and information management; research, forecasting, and modeling; service development and delivery; and training and capacity building. To date, more than 14 million people have benefited from PPCR support.\n\nBy joining the Alliance, CIF furthers its commitment to help developing countries make informed decisions and advance their adaptation and resilience actions in a more systematic way.\n\nThe CIF is joining the other 12 organizations who have united efforts to form the Alliance which was launched at COP 25 in Madrid in December 2019. Through collective action, the Alliance members have committed to achieve the common goal of closing the capacity gap on hydromet services by 2030.\n\nMafalda Duarte, Chief Executive Officer of the CIF, said: “Well-functioning weather and climate information services are necessary to effectively manage the risks associated with an uncertain and warming climate and build resilient economies and communities. However, the developing countries who bear the greatest burden of the impacts of climate change are also the ones facing capacity constraints to produce timely and accurate forecasts, early warnings, and climate projections. Through the Alliance, we will continue to support developing countries bridge this hydromet capacity gap and lay the foundation for resilient and sustainable development.”\n\nAccording to Petteri Taalas, WMO Secretary-General, “The Climate Investment Funds are a major player supporting countries on delivering reliable weather and climate services. We warmly welcome them as a new member of the Alliance, further strengthening our joint efforts to scale up and unite our efforts to close the hydromet capacity gap.”\n\nDuring the event, the CIF is also releasing a knowledge piece titled, Strengthening Weather and Climate Information Services for Resilience: Highlights from PPCR-supported projects. It draws on the operational experiences of PPCR in supporting partner countries build their capacity in delivering and using weather and climate information services. To continue generating and disseminating learning on this important topic, the CIF will also be launching an in-depth learning review on its PPCR hydromet-related activities.\n\nMoving forward, CIF and other members of the Alliance will continue to work in the following areas:  \n\n\n\tImproving systematic observations for better data by strengthening country capacity for sustained operation of observational systems and establish the SOFF to finance developing country observations in new, more effective ways.\n\tEnhancing support for better adaptation, mitigation, and resilience by strengthening country capacity for science-based mitigation and adaptation planning.\n\tStrengthening early warning systems for improved disaster risk management by developing multi-hazard national warning systems that consist of better risk information, forecasting capabilities, warning dissemination, and anticipatory response.\n\tBoosting investments for better effectiveness and sustainability by fostering programmatic approaches that go beyond individual projects, including systematically strengthening the WMO’s integrated global, regional, and national operational hydromet system.     \n\n\nThe actions of the Alliance are guided by the principles of UN agreements, including the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030.\n\nThe Alliance is open for membership to all public international development, humanitarian, and financial institutions providing assistance to strengthen developing countries’ hydromet capacity.\n  "},

Land management alone cannot explain recent increases in wildfires, according to an update from internationally acclaimed scientists.\n\nAn initial ScienceBrief Review on the link between climate change and wildfire risk was conducted in January 2020, reviewing 57 scientific articles. 116 scientific articles are now available. This update focuses on articles relevant to the wildfires ongoing in the western United States, new findings relevant to the wildfires that raged in southeastern Australia during the 2019-2020, and new findings since January 2020. \n\nIt is part of a collection on Critical Issues in Climate Change Science, prepared for the COP26 climate conference to be held in Glasgow (2021). \n\nThe Northern hemisphere just had its hottest summer and hottest August on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The most notable temperature departures from average during August 2020 included the western contiguous United States. The states of California, Oregon and Washington have been worst hit by wildfires, with dozens of casualties, razing entire neighbourhoods to the ground and forcing the evacuation of thousands of people. At the end of September, the US National Weather Service said that another extended heatwave is returning to South West California, and warned of more critical fire day for parts of California because of high temperatures, dry conditions and gusty winds.\n\nAccording to the ScienceBrief Review Update, new scientific publications reviewed since January 2020 strengthen the evidence that climate change increases the frequency and/or severity of fire weather – periods with a high fire risk due to a combination of high temperatures, low humidity, low rainfall and often high winds – in many regions around the world.\n\nThe western United States is among the regions where the trends in fire weather have been most pronounced in the past at least 40 years. Fire activity is influenced by a range of other factors including land management practices. However, land management alone cannot explain recent increases in wildfire extent and intensity in the western US or southeast Australia because increased fire weather amplifies fire risk where fuels remain available.\n\nThe new analysis shows that:\n\n\n\tWell over 100 studies published since 2013 show strong consensus that climate change promotes the weather conditions on which wildfires depend, enhancing their likelihood.\n\tNatural variability is superimposed on the increasingly warm and dry background conditions resulting from climate change, leading to more extreme fires and more extreme fire seasons.\n\tLand management can ameliorate or compound climate-driven changes in wildfire risk, either through fuel reductions or fuel accumulation as unintended byproduct of fire suppression. Fire suppression efforts are made more difficult by climate change.\n\tThere is an unequivocal and pervasive role of climate change in increasing the intensity and length in which fire weather occurs; land management is likely to have contributed too, but does not alone account for recent increases in wildfire extent and severity in the western US and in southeast Australia.\n\n\nAuthors: Adam J.

But until now, scientists have been unable to conclusively explain the reasons for this, because they were mostly focusing on atmospheric processes, according to a separate study from Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven (AWI).\n\n“Now, experts at the AWI have solved the puzzle: the alarming expansion of the tropics is not caused by processes in the atmosphere, but quite simply by warming subtropical ocean.\n\n“Our simulations show that an enhanced warming over the subtropical ocean in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are the main drivers,” said the AWI report in the Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres.\n  "},

The COVID19 pandemic has highlighted the necessity of the world’s merchant fleet, transporting vital medical supplies, food and other basic goods that are critical for the COVID19 response and recovery. It is imperative that maritime transport is developed sustainably, ensuring safety of life at sea, proper response to marine environmental emergencies and efficient ship routing services.\n\nSadly, we have been reminded recently of disasters at sea.  The oil spill accident along the Mauritius coast in July has damaged the local ecosystem and exacerbated pressure on local tourism industries. Meteo-France have been instrumental in supporting the official French and Mauritian response to the oil spill – ensuring regular and accurate ocean forecasting to monitor oil diffusion.  This has helped to contain contaminants. Unfortunately, further setback with the sinking of one of the oil spill response vessels in heavy swell conditions in September highlights the need for continued vigilance and use of available marine weather information in decision making. Similarly, another recent tragic situation was the downing of the Gulf Livestock 1 on September 2, carrying a crew of 43, and 5800 head of cattle, from New Zealand to China. It occurred when the ship encountered Typhoon Maysak with winds reported at 100 knots. The Search and Rescue (SAR) Operation was particularly challenging with another extreme event, Typhoon Haishen, hitting this area afterwards. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) provided vital marine meteorological information on Typhoons Maysak and Haishen, issued by Regional Specialized Meteorology Center (RSMC) Tokyo, in supporting the Japan Coast Guard to facilitate the SAR efforts.\n\nThese accidents highlight the reliance of safety of life at sea, environmental emergency response and a sustainable blue economy, on robust met-ocean services, along with the appropriate training for shipping companies and ships’ crews.\n\nTrack forecast of tropical and extra-tropical cyclones continues to improve, allowing ship captains to navigate accordingly. Most recently, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Hurricane Center forecast the landfall of this year’s hurricane Laura within a mile of its actual landfall three days in advance. Preliminary evidence from examining the automatic identification system (AIS) data reported by ships, in comparison with marine warning areas during Laura, suggests that extreme weather avoidance practices have generally been implemented by the maritime community near tropical cyclones. However, more work is needed, as many vessels still receive Maritime Safety Information (MSI) via text and are unable to receive graphical forecasts or data that could be integrated into shipboard navigational systems.  And ships still occasionally find themselves in peril near tropical cyclones and other storms at sea, as in the case of Gulf Livestock 1.\n\nThese types of situations were discussed in October 2019 at the First WMO-IMO International Symposium on Extreme Maritime Weather - Towards Safety of Life at Sea and a Sustainable Blue Economy in London.  Stakeholders from shipping, offshore industry, ports and harbors, coast guards, insurance providers and the met-ocean community came together to identify best practices for improving services for safety of life at sea and emergency response and sustainable shipping.   “We must apply the gains we’ve made in science, observing, computing, and communications to bring relevant 21st century services to the maritime community.  We must develop a stronger partnership with this community to improve safety of life and property at sea,” said the Symposium Chair, Thomas Cuff of NOAA.  \n\nThe WMO works to support Members in fulfilling their responsibility to provide meteorological MSI under the International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s International Convention on Safety Of Life At Sea (SOLAS) through the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS).\n\nThe Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), co-sponsored by WMO, Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC), UN Environment and International Science Council (ISC), provides vital met-ocean data for maritime operations. Unfortunately, the availability of these data has been disrupted due to the reduction in global shipping trade under the COVID19 pandemic. The WMO, IMO and IOC encourage shipping companies to participate in the collection and sharing of met-ocean data for mutual benefit, through the joint WMO-IOC Voluntary Observation Ship (VOS) Scheme managed by the WMO-IOC JCOMM in-situ Observations Programme Support Centre (JCOMMOPS).\n\nThe value of met-ocean data and services for safe and efficient maritime transport and boosting the sustainable global economy, especially during the COVID19 pandemic, cannot be overstated.  \n\nContact: mmo@wmo.int\n  "},

Vicky is the earliest 20th Atlantic named storm on record.  The old record was set by Vince on October 9, 2005. The season lasts until 30 November.\n\nThe hurricane name lists include only 21 letters out of 26, because it is not easy to find 6 appropriate names (for the 6 rotating lists) starting with Q, U, X, Y and Z. In the interests of safety, names must be easily recognizable. In addition, they have to reflect a balance between French, Spanish and English names due to the geographical coverage of the storms throughout the Atlantic and Caribbean, and respect societal sensitivities.\n\nThe use of the Greek alphabet (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Theta, etc) has only happened once before in 2005, when six names from the Greek Alphabet were used. This was a record-breaking year with devastating hurricanes including Katrina, Rita and Wilma, whose names were all retired.\n\nThe name of a tropical cyclone may be retired or withdrawn from the active list at the request of any Member State if that tropical cyclone acquires special notoriety because of the human casualties and damage incurred. It is through consensus opinion of the members (or the majority, if required) during the session of the WMO Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee immediately following that season, that the name would be withdrawn from the active list.\n\nThe  Hurricane Committee annual session in 2006 discussed the use of the Greek alphabet for hurricane naming, and whether a Greek Alphabet name should be retired as done for a regular name when it meets the criteria for retirement.\n\nThe Committee felt that the use of the Greek Alphabet was not expected to be frequent enough to warrant any change in the existing naming procedure for the foreseeable future and therefore decided that the naming system would remain unchanged and that the Greek alphabet would continue to be used.\n\nIn this connection, the Committee also agreed that it was not practical to “retire into hurricane history” a letter in the Greek Alphabet. It therefore decided that if a significant storm designated by a letter of the Greek Alphabet, in either the Atlantic or eastern North Pacific Basin, was considered worthy of being “retired”, it would be included in the list of retired names with the year of occurrence and other details, but that the particular letter in the Greek Alphabet would continue to be available for use in the future”.\n\nConsiderations for 2019 storm name retirements was not completed and will be addressed at the 2021 meeting (43rd session) of the WMO Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee, as the 2019 names will not be used again until 2025. The 2025 name list will not be updated until the 2021 meeting has been completed.\n\n \n  "},

It was the second lowest extent only after the record low observed in 2012.", "issueTime": "22 September 2020", "url": "https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/arctic-sea-ice-minimum-2nd-lowest-record", "detail": "\n    Arctic sea ice – a key climate change indicator - has reached its annual minimum extent after the summer melt season. It was the second lowest extent only after the record low observed in 2012.\n\nThe U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) announced that on 15 September, sea ice extent was 3.74 million square kilometers (1.44 million square miles). The Alfred Wegener Institute Institute confirmed this reading, with figures from the University of Bremen saying it was 3.8 million square km. Other space agencies and data providers, for example EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) and Japan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) concur that the second lowest sea-ice extent was reached this year.\n\nThe 2020 figure—preliminary because a late-season surge of summer warmth could still drop the extent further—continued an observed trend of long-term Arctic sea ice decline.\n\nThe last 14 years—2007 to 2020—have the lowest 14 minimum extents of the 42-year satellite record.\n\nThere are a number of causes for the massive loss of ice this summer. This includes extremely high air and water temperatures. Accordingly, heat impacted the ice from both above and below, resulting in widespread melting.  \n\nA record-breaking heatwave and unprecedented wildfires in Siberia were a major contributing factor during a northern hemisphere summer which will leave a deep wound in the cryosphere, with major impacts on ice shelves and glaciers in the northern hemisphere.  \n\n“It's been a crazy year up north, with sea ice at a near-record low, 100-degree (Fahrenheit) heat waves in Siberia, and massive forest fires,” said Mark Serreze, director of NSIDC. “The year 2020 will stand as an exclamation point on the downward trend in Arctic sea ice extent. We are headed towards a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean, and this year is another nail in the coffin.”\n\n“This threshold means the Arctic is more ocean than ice, a blue highway that’s been open since mid-July and won’t close until well into October,” said Ted Scambos, senior research scientist at the Earth Science Observation Center at the University of Colorado-Boulder.\n\nTemperatures in the Arctic are rising more than twice as fast as the global average. Unique amplification processes and feedbacks, such as the rapid decline of sea ice, significantly contribute to this warming. The consequences of a warming Arctic will be far-reaching across the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe fast-warming Arctic has started to transition from a predominantly frozen state into an entirely different climate, according to a comprehensive new study of Arctic conditions by scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).\n\n\"The rate of change is remarkable,\" said NCAR scientist Laura Landrum, the lead author of the study published in Nature Climate Change. \"It's a period of such rapid change that observations of past weather patterns no longer show what you can expect next year. The Arctic is already entering a completely different climate than just a few decades ago.\"\n\nIn the new study, Landrum and her co-author, NCAR scientist Marika Holland, find that Arctic sea ice has melted so significantly in recent decades that even an unusually cold year will no longer have the amount of summer sea ice that existed as recently as the mid-20th century. Autumn and winter air temperatures will also warm enough to enter a statistically distinct climate by the middle of this century, followed by a seasonal change in precipitation that will result in additional months in which rain will fall instead of snow.\n\nAmong long-time observers of Arctic sea ice, the 2020 value was significant in that it not only punctuated a long-term decline, but also because it fell below the 4-million-kilometer (1.5-million-mile) threshold for only the second time in the satellite record—after  2012, when the minimum extent dipped to 3.39 million square kilometers (1.31 million square miles).\n\nThe exact time at which the sea ice reaches its absolute minimum depends on the weather conditions in the Arctic, and can only be determined once there is clear evidence that the sea-ice extent has begun to grow again. Based on past experience, this usually comes in mid-September, though sometimes not until the second half of the month.\n\nThe sea ice extent is measured by satellite data, including by NASA, the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) at the University of Colorado Boulder, AWI, the EUMETSAT OSI SAF, and JAXA-NiPR. Sea-ice extent is defined as the area where ice concentration is at least 15 percent.\n\nThe rapid ice melting was observed in detail by experts on board the German research icebreaker Polarstern, which is the central observatory for the most ambitious Arctic research expedition ever undertaken and involving scientists from 17 nations.\n\n“The scale of Arctic sea-ice retreat this year was breath-taking. Just a short time ago, when we reached the North Pole, we could see broad stretches of open water reaching nearly to the Pole, surrounded by ice that was riddled with holes produced by massive melting. The Arctic ice is disappearing at a dramatic rate. With the MOSAiC expedition, we’re investigating the underlying processes on site, and in more detail than ever before, so that we can accurately represent these rapid changes in the Arctic in our climate models,” says Expedition Leader Prof Markus Rex.\n\nPolar Stern crossed in the geographic North Pole on 19 August, passing through the Fram Strait on the North-east side of Greenland in a region that used to be home to thick multi-year ice.\n\n \n  "},

It shows that collective action, guided by science, is the only way to solve major global crises. The slogan of the day is ‘Ozone for life’ – the ozone layer is crucial for life on Earth and needs protecting for future generations.\n\n\n\nThe Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer was adopted in 1985. Under the Convention’s Montreal Protocol, governments, scientists and industry worked together to cut out 99 per cent of all ozone-depleting substances.\n\n“The ozone layer is now healing, safeguarding human and ecosystem health. But the work of the Montreal Protocol is not over. Through the Protocol’s Kigali Amendment, the international community is finding alternatives for coolants that contribute to the growing menace of climate disruption. If fully implemented, the Kigali Amendment can prevent 0.4 degrees Celsius of global warming,” said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nThe latest WMO /UN Environment Programme Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion, issued in 2018, concluded that these measures will lead the ozone layer on the path of recovery and to potential return of the ozone values over Antarctica to pre-1980 levels by 2060.\n\nAlthough the use of halons and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) has been discontinued, they will remain in the atmosphere for many decades. Even if there were no new emissions, there is still more than enough chlorine and bromine present in the atmosphere to destroy ozone at certain altitudes over Antarctica from August to December.\n\nThe formation of the ozone hole is still expected to be an annual spring event. Its size and depth are governed to a large degree by the meteorological conditions particular for the year.\n\nAs of the first half of August 2020, the ozone hole reappeared and is rapidly growing. Its evolution is being monitored by means of satellites and a number of ground-based observing stations of the Global Atmosphere Watch Programme. Those observations are being combined with numerical modeling by different organizations and institutions including NASA, the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service implemented by ECMWF, Environment and Climate Change Canada, and the Netherlands national meteorological institute KNMI to provide near -real time information and analyses on the ozone levels at different parts of the stratosphere, the location and dimensions of the ozone depleted area.\n\nSpecific dynamic conditions in the stratosphere in 2019 led to the smallest Antarctic ozone hole since the ozone hole was first discovered.\n\nImage: NASA Ozone Watch product based on satellite observations for 12 September 2020. The false-color view of the monthly-averaged total ozone over the Antarctic pole. The blue and purple colors are where there is the least ozone, and the yellows and reds are where there is more ozone. The area of the ozone hole is determined by locations where  the total ozone concentration falls below 220 Dobson units.\n\n \n\n \n\nArctic Ozone Hole\n\nThe amount of ozone depleting substances in the atmosphere is also sufficient to cause ozone destruction in the Arctic atmosphere. This is not an annual phenomenon because the Arctic stratosphere is usually less isolated and it does not experience very low temperatures for extended period of time which are required for sustaining the ozone destruction.\n\nA combination of unusually weak upper atmospheric waves, strong stratospheric polar vortex with consistent very low temperatures for long period of time in the spring of 2020 resulted in an early formation of the record low ozone levels over the Arctic lower stratosphere. The full impact of such strong ozone depletion, which would have been even worse if it had not been for the Montreal Protocol, is still being evaluated.\n\nImpact of COVID-19 on ozone monitoring\n\nThe last spring seasons in the Antarctic and Arctic underline the importance of monitoring the nature and the impact of the different drivers on the extent of the ozone destruction. \n\nMeteorological, ozone and UV radiation observations and data delivery have been and continue to be impacted by lockdowns and mandatory teleworking policies introduced in relation to COVID-19. The extent of this impact is depending on their location, measuring techniques, instruments’ automation, requirements for service and calibration, state and requirements of telecommunications. \n\n\n\nBecause large parts of the surface-based weather, ozone and UV observations are either partly or fully automated, those are expect\n\ned to continue functioning without significant degradation for weeks, in some cases even longer. \n\nWorst affected is the southern hemisphere, especially in Africa and parts of Central and South America where many observations and meteorological stations are manual. \n\nSome ozone observing stations rely on manually taken observations which are subsequently transmitted into the international networks for use in models and forecasts. In some of those stations, ozone and UV observations are supported by the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services which continue to perform their essential 24/7 functions and continuity of the monitoring activities is not at risk.\n\nHowever, if the pandemic is prolonged, then missing repair, maintenance and supply work will affect those observations. While increasing concern is the frequency and continuity of the observations in the COVID impacted areas which are not automated or not supported by NHMS, the quality of global observations could suffer due to delays or lack of regular and emergency services and calibrations and training activities which are currently suspended.\n\nIn celebrating World Ozone Day, WMO recognizes the united efforts of 197 UN Member States that ratified the Montreal Protocol. We also pay tribute to the hard work and dedication of all operators of instrumentation for continuing the atmospheric monitoring and observations of ozone, UV radiation and ozone depleting substance despite the constraints of the COVID-19. \n\n \n\nDetails of World Ozone Day available here  \n  "},

If things would remain as they are, we would go up 3 to 5 degrees above the pre-industrial level,” Mr Guterres told a press conference.\n\nThe United in Science 2020 report, the second in an annual series, is coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). It includes input from the Global Carbon Project, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, the UN Environment Programme and the UK Met Office. It presents the very latest scientific data and findings related to climate change to inform global policy and action.\n\n\n\n“The science is solid,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas told the press conference in a virtual linkup from WMO headquarters in Geneva. He presented the key findings of the report, and its underlying message of the report is that climate change has not stopped for COVID19. Greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are at record levels and continue to increase. Emissions are heading in the direction of pre-pandemic levels following a temporary decline caused by the lockdown and economic slowdown.\n\nThe presentation by Professor Taalas also highlighted the increasing impacts of climate change, which affects glaciers, oceans, nature, economies and human living conditions and is often felt through water-related hazards like drought or flooding.\n\n“As the report shows, greenhouse gas concentrations reached new record highs in 2020. The last time levels were this high was between 2.6 and 5.3 million years ago, in the Pliocene era when there were trees at the South Pole and sea levels were some 20 metres higher,” said Mr Guterres. \n\n“The five-year period since the signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change will be the hottest on human record -- with average global temperatures of 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels. The report also rings the alarm that there is a significant and growing chance of temporarily reaching the 1.5-degree threshold in the coming five years,” said Mr Guterres, citing data from the report. \n\n“The latest data for Greenland alone shows an average loss of ice mass of 278 billion tons a year – more than 110 million Olympic sized swimming pools.  And this is Greenland alone - 110 million Olympic sized swimming pools have lost ice in Greenland alone.  Let’s not forget that there is Antarctica. Let’s not forget that there are glaciers all over the world,” said Mr Guterres.  \n\nOver the next five years, the Arctic is predicted to continue warming at over twice the overall global rate. \n\n“We have a choice: business as usual, leading to further calamity; or we can use the recovery from COVID-19 to provide a real opportunity to put the world on a sustainable path,” said Mr Guterres.He outlined six climate-related actions to shape the recovery.  \n\nFirst, as we spend huge amounts of money to recover from the coronavirus, we must deliver new jobs and businesses through a clean, green transition. \n\nSecond, where taxpayers’ money is used to rescue businesses, it needs to be tied to achieving green jobs and sustainable growth. \n\nThird, fiscal firepower must drive a shift from the grey to the green economy and make societies and people more resilient.  \n\nFourth, public funds should be used to invest in the future, not the past, and flow to sustainable sectors and projects that help the environment and the climate. And so, fossil fuel subsidies must end, polluters must pay for their pollution, and no new coal power plants should be built.  It is already cheaper to build new renewable energy capacity than to continue operating 39 per cent of the world’s existing coal capacity.  \n\nFifth, climate risks and opportunities must be incorporated into the financial system, as well as all aspects of public policymaking and infrastructure.  \n\nAnd, lastly, we need to work together as an international community.   \n\n“As we work to tackle both the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis, I urge leaders to heed the facts in this report, unite behind the science and take urgent climate action,” said Mr Guterres. \n\nDetails of Prof Taalas presentation, the report, press release, digital assets are available here\n\nhttps://trello.com/b/g5Tc8gjD/united-in-science\n  "},

The Copernicus Climate Change Service implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ranked it as the fourth warmest August on record globally. WMO consolidates different international datasets for its reports on the state of the global climate.\n\n\n\nAugust 2020 marked the 44th consecutive August and the 428th consecutive month with temperatures, at least nominally, above the 20th-century average. The 10 warmest Augusts have all occurred since 1998. The five warmest Augusts have occurred since 2015, according to NOAA.\n\nThe most notable temperature departures from average during August 2020 included the western contiguous United States, which is suffering a destructive fire season.\n\nRecord-breaking fires\n\nThe states of California, Oregon and Washington have been worst hit, with dozens of casualties, razing entire neighbourhoods to the ground and forcing the evacuation of thousands of people.\n\nAs of 13 September, nearly 16,500 firefighters continue working to gain containment on the 28 major wildfires across California. Since the beginning of the year, wildfires have burned over 3.2 million acres in California. Since August 15, when California’s fire activity elevated, there have been 24 fatalities and over 4,200 structures destroyed, according to Cal Fire.\n\nThe fires have impacted air quality for millions of people and turned skies orange. Clouds of smoke have billowed over the western Pacific and Atlantic.\n\nData from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts on behalf of the European Commission, reveal that the wildfires he Western United States are significantly more intense than the 2003-2019 average for the whole country. CAMS, which monitors daily wildfire activity worldwide using satellite observations of their intensity to estimate emissions of atmospheric pollutants, has tracked the long-range transport of the smoke as far as 8,000 kilometres away to reach Northern Europe. The fires burning in California since mid-August, and in Oregon and Washington since the beginning of September, have emitted vast quantities of thick smoke that have affected a huge area. The fires emitted an estimated 21,7 megatonnes of carbon in California, 7,3 megatonnes of carbon in Oregon and 1,4 megatonnes of carbon in Washington. Overall emissions for Western USA were up to estimated 30,3 megatonnes of carbon.  \n\nCauses\n\nAccording to the US National Interagency Fire Center, of the 41,599 fires to date this year, 36,383 were human-caused, burning a total of 2,510,743 acres across the United States. California remained in the first spot, with 7,072 human-caused fires reported.\n\nWeather, climate and water-related conditions were also conducive to rapid wildfire growth.\n\nDrought: The western United States has seen an expansion of drought conditions over the first half of 2020. In August, the dry conditions and high temperatures continued and worsened drought across the West. The percent area of the contiguous United States experiencing some level of drought increased by 7 percentage points in August, leaving nearly 40% of the country in drought.\n\nHeatwave: A record-breaking heatwave settled over the Western USA during the middle of August. Temperatures soared to a recorded 54.4°C (130°F) in Death Valley, California. A WMO team of experts will verify this temperature reading. \n\nStrong winds fed off the heat and low humidity and fanned the flames.\n\nMoisture from a rapidly weakening tropical storm to the south resulted in strong thunderstorms moving into coastal California accompanied by thousands of lightning strikes. According to CalFire, between August 15 and the end of August, more than 14,000 lightning strikes occurred.\n\nConnection to climate change\n\nSix of the top 20 largest wildfires in California history have occurred this year, according to Cal Fire. In Cal-Fire’s list of the top twenty largest wildfires, eight of the top ten have occurred in the last ten years, and seventeen of the top twenty have occurred since 2000. Seven of the top ten most destructive wildfires have occurred since 2015.\n\nWildfires are a part of the natural cycle of life in many ecosystems across the western United States. As a fire blazes, it kills pests, while germinating a generation of new seedlings, and the forest growth cycle begins anew. But too many wildfires potentially permanently altering the ecosystem.\n\nThe Fourth National Climate Assessment, a US government inter-agency report, notes that from 1984 to 2015, climate change led to twice as much land being burned than if climate change had not occurred.  And even though there are other factors involved in the acreage wildfires burn—like fire suppression and local fire management practices—from 1916 to 2003, the area burned by wildfires was likely also driven by climate factors.\n\nAccording to the Fourth National Climate Assessment, climate change has led to more intense droughts, especially across California. These droughts, combined with increased temperatures, have desiccated forests, making them tinderboxes.\n\nThe report said that the 2011–2015 meteorological drought in California, combined with future warming, will lead to long-term changes in land cover, leading to increased probability of climate feedbacks (e.g., drought and wildfire) and in ecosystem shifts. \n\n \n  "},

New assessments of borehole measurements show that the land heating is 6%. About 4% of excess heat causes loss (melting) of both land ice and floating ice.\n\nDirect impacts of this heating, driven by heat-trapping anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, include sea-level rise, ice loss, and warming of the ocean, land and atmosphere. The results also show that EEI not only continues, it increases: the EEI amounted to 0.87 + 0.12 W/m2 during 2010-2018.\n\nStabilization of climate change requires the EEI to be reduced to approximately zero to regain a quasi-equilibrium state in the Earth system.\n\nThis study calculates that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere must be reduced from the present concentration of nearly 410 ppm to approximately 350 ppm to bring the Earth back towards energy balance.\n\n“The EEI calculation is hence the best single metric we have of how well we are doing in our attempts to bring climate change under control. Improved quantification and reduced uncertainties of the EEI can only be achieved through sustained international multi-disciplinary collaboration and enhanced global climate observations with extensions to cover important gaps such as the deep ocean and the cryosphere,” said the study, led by Karina von Schuckmann of Mercator Ocean International.\n\nThe publication is available here\n\n\n  "},

Preliminary findings indicate it was in proper working condition at the time of the observation.\n\nWMO will now assemble an international team of atmospheric scientists to carefully examine the observation (including equipment and observation practices) for its Weather and Climate Extremes Archive.\n\nTo verify a new temperature record, the committee of experts has to examine the observation, the equipment, the calibration and observation practices, its correspondence to surrounding stations, etc. \n\n“These investigations are quite detailed and take time so it is likely that there will not be a full completed evaluation for many months -- although at this time based on available evidence, we are preliminarily accepting the observation (pending the completion of a full examination,” said WMO Weather and Climate Extremes rapporteur Randall Cerveny.\n\nHeatwave\n\n“We are in the midst of a long-duration extreme heat event. Another run at 130°F+ temperatures in Death Valley remains possible,” tweeted NWS Las Vegas.\n\nThe scorching conditions come amid a heatwave on the US west coast, with many new temperature records. More than 56 million Americans are under some sort of heat alert.\n\nThe National Weather Service warned that the sweltering heat will continue its grip in the western part of the United States, with widespread temperatures in the 100s, with 110s and 120s (high 30°C to high 40°C) in the Desert Southwest. Critical fire weather threats continue, with thunderstorms and gusty winds.\n\nThe heatwave has led to a huge strain on energy utilities.\n\nClimate Change\n\nThe extreme high temperatures are part of a trend. As a result of climate change, temperature records are being broken more frequently than in the past. Heatwaves are more frequent and more intense.\n\nJuly was the hottest July on record for the northern hemisphere, and Arctic sea ice was the lowest on record for the month of July. January to July was the second warmest January to July on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nWestern and Central Europe witnessed another heatwave, with a number of new station records in the second week of August. The warm air will move now to Eastern parts of Europe. Forecasts imply that there is some possibility that warm air might be stationary for 1-2 weeks especially over some western parts of Eastern Europe, namely Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova.\n\nJapan on 17 August tied its national record, with 41.1°C recorded at Hamamatsu. The Japan Meteorological Agency alerts that the extremely hot weather conditions will continue to around 21 August in western and eastern Japan and the daily maximum temperature will exceed 35 degrees C in these areas. According to JMA's two-week temperature forecast and one-month forecast, warmer-than-normal climate conditions are expected to continue for the next month.\n\nSiberia experienced a prolonged heatwave, with a recorded temperature of 38° Celsius on 20 June in the Russian town of Verkhoyansk. WMO is currently examining whether this is a new record for the Arctic Circle. \n\nHistoric records\n\nAccording to the Weather and Climate Extremes archive, the hottest temperature ever recorded was in Furnace Creek, Death Valley, California at 56.7°C on 10 July 1913. The highest temperature for the Eastern hemisphere was set in July 1931 in Kebili, Tunisia, at 55.0°C.\n\nOther high temperature records include 54.0 °C in Mitribah, Kuwait, on 21 July 2016 and a second in Turbat, Pakistan, on 28 May 2017.\n\nSome weather historians have questioned the accuracy of old temperature records. The WMO Archive for Weather & Climate Extremes is always willing to investigate any past extreme record when new credible evidence is presented.\n \n  "},

We have the solutions and technology to change this. To improve our air quality we need everyone on board –from individuals to private companies to governments.\n\n“Around the world, nine out of every ten people breathe unclean air. Air pollution contributes to heart disease, strokes, lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. It causes an estimated 7 million premature deaths every year, predominantly in low- and middle-income countries. Air pollution also threatens the economy, food security and the environment, said UN Secretary-General António Guterres.\n\n“As we recover from the coronavirus pandemic, the world needs to pay far greater attention to air pollution, which also increases the risks associated with COVID-19,” he said.\n\nEvidence indicates population exposure to air pollution, in the form of fine particulate matter, affects the severity of COVID-19 symptoms, according to a statement issued at the end of a virtual symposium on climatological, meteorological and environmental factors in the COVID-19 pandemic, co-organized by WMO from 4-6 August. \n\n\n\nThe outcomes document said that this information should be considered when assessing and responding to patterns of COVID-19 vulnerability. Impacts of other air quality parameters are less clear, and the role of air quality in transmission rates is still under investigation.\n\nWMO continuously works toward enhanced  availability and quality of observations of several important air pollutants such as black carbon, tropospheric ozone,atmospheric dust through the Global Atmosphere Watch programme to support evidence-based policy on the environment. WMO Members are working on development of the forecasting systems that can help reduce acute air pollution episodes.  WMO also leads global research and strengthens scientific knowledge on connections between air quality and climate and develop the science-based tools to support policy-making on air pollution and climate change mitigation.\n\nCombating air pollution is one of the priorities of the WMO-World Health Organization Joint Office on Climate and Health and WMO has signed up to the global commitment to reduce deaths due to air pollution by two thirds by 2030. WMO Congress in 2019 approved a five year plan to improve the sustainable provision of integrated urban and health services, with a focus on air quality. \n\nThe WMO Global Atmosphere Watch initiated the Global Air Quality Forecasting and Information System (GAFIS) initiative which builds a platform for providers and user of air quality forecast and information systems. It will enable access to, and use of, air quality prediction and analysis products at various temporal and spatial scales by diverse community interested in air quality.\n\n \n\n \n  "},

Category 4 Hurricane Laura made landfall on 27 August on the US Gulf Coast.", "issueTime": "28 August 2020", "url": "https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/hurricane-laura-hits-usa", "detail": "\n    An already active Atlantic hurricane season is entering what is traditionally its most active phase. Hurricane Laura made landfall on 27 August on the U.S. Gulf Coast. It intensified within 24 hours from a category 1 to a strong category 4 on the Saffir Simson scale.\n\nLaura made landfall in with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (241 km/h). In terms of wind speed, it was the strongest storm (tied) to hit Louisiana\n\n\n\n since 1856. Laura is the first major hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico during August since Harvey in 2017.\n\nLaura has now generated more Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) than all of the other Atlantic named storms during August so far combined (Isaias, Josephine, Kyle and Marco). ACE is an integrated metric accounting for intensity and duration of storms.\n\nIt is the 7th named storm to landfall in the United States this season. It is by far the most intense and dangerous hurricane so far. We have only just entered what is traditionally the most intense period of the season. “We still have a long way to go, with climatology saying we have about 70% of strong activity in the season still left,” according to Eric Blake, senior hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe forecasts issued by the US National Hurricane Center were extremely accurate. The accurate forecasts, together with an effective disaster management response seems to kept the death toll to a minimum, according to initial casualty reports. More than 20 people died, mostly in Haiti, when Laura was still classed as a tropical storm.\n\nThe airport at Lake Charles, Louisiana, reported a gust of 206 km/h (137 mph). The doppler radar from National Weather Service Lake Charles was destroyed – these are usually constructed to withstand winds of between 200 and 240 km/h. TV images showed many destroyed buildings in Lake Charles.\n\nA National Ocean Service tide station at Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana observed a water level rise of 9 feet mean high water.\n\nActive season\n\nThere have so far been 13 named storms this season.\n\nNOAA’s updated hurricane season outlook issued on 6 August indicates that an above-normal hurricane season is very likely, and there is an increased possibility of the season being extremely active, with 19-25 named storms, including 7-11 hurricanes and 3-6 major hurricanes (category 3 and above). This is because of conducive atmospheric and oceanic conditions in the part of the Atlantic where tropical storms develop, such as well above average sea surface temperatures,  weaker trade winds, weaker windshear and a strong west African monsoon.\n\nWMO’s newly issued El Niño/La Niña Update says there is a 60 % chance of a La Niña forming between September and November 2020. The absence of an El Niño – which tends to suppress hurricane activity – therefore does play a role. But it is not the only factor. \n\nNOAA’s updated hurricane season outlook issued on 6 August indicates that an above-normal hurricane season is very likely, and there is an increased possibility of the season being extremely active, with 19-25 named storms, including 7-11 hurricanes and 3-6 major hurricanes (category 3 and above). This is  because of conducive atmospheric and oceanic conditions in the part of the Atlantic where tropical storms develop, such as well above average sea surface temperatures,  weaker trade winds, weaker windshear and a strong west African monsoon.\n\nEmergency preparations and management are being complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe situation in the Gulf coast area stands in contrast to the raging wildfires in the West coast which have destroyed more than 1 million acres (more than 400,000 hectares) and claimed a number of lives. The US National Weather Service is warning of the risk of more dry thunderstorms which bring little rain but pose an additional fire threat.\n\n \n\nRelationship with Climate Change\n\nIt is difficult to link any particular individual tropical cyclone to climate change. But we do expect to see more powerful storms in future as a result of global warming. That's because storms feed on warm water, and higher water temperatures also lead to sea-level rise, which in turn increases the risk of flooding during high tides and in the event of storm surges. Warmer air also holds more atmospheric water vapor, which enables tropical storms to strengthen and unleash more precipitation.\n\nA summary statement issued in 2018 by Tom Knutson, Chair, WMO Task Team on Tropical Cyclones and Climate Change, said:\n\n\"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report presents a strong body of scientific evidence that most of the global warming observed over the past half century is very likely due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.   But what does this change mean for hurricane activity?  Here, we address these questions, starting with those conclusions where we have relatively more confidence:\n\nSea level rise–which very likely has a substantial human contribution to the global mean observed rise according to IPCC AR5--could be causing higher storm surge levels for tropical cyclones that do occur, all else assumed equal.\n\nTropical cyclone rainfall rates will likely increase in the future due to anthropogenic warming and accompanying increase in atmospheric moisture content.  Models project an increase on the order of 10-15% for rainfall rates averaged within about 100 km of the storm for a 2 degree Celsius global warming scenario.\n\nTropical cyclone intensities globally will likely increase on average (by 1 to 10% according to model projections for a 2 degree Celsius global warming). This change would imply an even larger percentage increase in the destructive potential per storm, assuming no reduction in storm size.  Storm size responses to anthropogenic warming are uncertain.\n\nThe global proportion of tropical cyclones that reach very intense (Category 4 and 5) levels will likely increase due to anthropogenic warming over the next century.  There is less confidence in future projections of the global number of Category 4 and 5 storms, since most modeling studies project a decrease (or little change) in the global frequency of all tropical cyclones combined. \n\n \n  "},

The WMO Global Cryosphere Watch network and the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative has prepared a report of the main events, based on contributions from different partners.\n\nWMO is playing an increasingly active role in the cryosphere domain as the changing environments have increased the demand for sustained services in polar and high-mountain areas and downstream. These depend on the integration of actionable information on the state of the cryosphere.\n\nTemperatures in the Arctic are rising faster than the global average. Unique amplification processes and feedbacks, such as the rapid decline of sea ice, significantly contribute to this warming. The consequences of a warming Arctic will be far-reaching across the northern hemisphere.\n\nIce sheets in Greenland and Antarctica whose melting rates are rapidly increasing have raised the global sea level by 1.8cm since the 1990s, and are matching the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's worst-case climate warming scenarios, according to a new study published in Nature Climate Change. \n\nIf these rates continue, the ice sheets are expected to raise sea levels by a further 17cm and expose an additional 16 million people to annual coastal flooding by the end of the century. Since the ice sheets were first monitored by satellite in the 1990s, melting from Antarctica has pushed global sea levels up by 7.2mm, while Greenland has contributed 10.6mm. And the latest measurements show that the world's oceans are now rising by 4mm each year, according to the study from the University of Leeds and the Danish Meteorological Institute, which is one of the collaborators in Global Cryosphere Watch.\n\nTemperature records\n\nA number of new temperature records were set in 2020. On 20 June, the Siberian town of Verkhoyansk located above the Arctic circle at 67.55°N experienced 38 °C (100.4°F) for the first time, as confirmed by the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring. Maximum temperatures in June exceeded 30 °C for 10 days prior to that.\n\nFurther north, on the Svalbard archipelago, at 78°N, a new temperature measurement shattered a 41-year-old record, with 21.7 °C (71°F) measured in the town of Longyearbyen on 25 July. Even further north, at Eureka station in Nunavut, the Canadian National Weather Service reported 21.9 °C (71.4 °F) on 11 August. The heatwave across the Arctic was accompanied by record-breaking wildfires in Russia, close-to record low sea ice extent, and the collapse of one of the last fully intact Canadian ice shelves.\n\nMajor calving of the Milne Ice Shelf, Canada\n\nBetween 30 and 31 July, an 81 km2 (30 mi2) portion of the Milne ice shelf broke off, reducing the total area of the ice shelf by 43%. The Canadian Ice Service cited the above-normal air temperatures, offshore and alongshore winds and the lack of sea ice, along with long-term thinning and the presence of pre-existing fractures, in addition to melt ponds on the ice surface.\n\nThe northern coast of Ellesmere Island is home to Canada’s Arctic Ice Shelves. These are typically made of continental ice that has flowed onto the ocean and nourished by glaciers, snowfall, and refrozen meltwater. In the Arctic, sea ice or fast-ice permanently connected to land is also a significant component of some ice shelves. Arctic ice shelves are less common than their Antarctic counterparts but host unique marine ecosystems inhabited by rich and rare biodiversity.\n\n“As a part of our operations we monitor the ice shelves for calving events that can produce large ice islands” says Adrienne White, an analyst with the Canadian Ice Service. “When the Milne Ice Shelf calved, we used satellite imagery, including Canada’s RCM satellites and ESA’s Sentinel-1 satellite imagery to monitor the progression of the calving event.”\n\nThe consequences of this collapse are several: the loss of a rare ecosystem, the potential acceleration of glaciers into the ocean leading to further sea level rise, and the formation of new drifting ice islands resulting from the calving.\n\nThe Milne Ice Shelf has produced two large ice islands measuring 55 km2 and 24 km2 which have already begun to drift southwest, long the coast of Ellesmere Island. These can be potentially hazardous to shipping and mining activities within the waterways.\n\n“As the climate warms in the Arctic, recent changes in the floating ice cover along northern Ellesmere Island show that an area that was once characterized by ice shelves, multiyear sea ice and floating glacier termini, is no longer capable of sustaining these types of features,” said Ms White.\n\n\n\nA glacial outburst flood in Iceland\n\nOn 17 August 2020, a flood occurred from a small marginal lake at the western margin of the Langjökull, Iceland´s second largest ice cap.\n\nThe lake has been forming over the past 20 years due to the steady retreat of the glacier, according to Thorsteinn Thorsteinsson, glaciologist at the Icelandic Meteorological Office.\n\nAccording to preliminary estimates, 3.4 million m3 were released from the lake, making this a small event in comparison with large outburst floods resulting from subglacial lakes and subglacial volcanism at other locations in Iceland. But it underscores the importance of monitoring the formation of new marginal lakes in a period of rapid glacier retreat, and assessing new flooding hazards and the impact on ecosystems.\n\nThe marginal glacial lake before and after the flooding event can be observed on two Sentinel images here.\n\n\n\nThe European Alps are warming\n\nTemperatures in the European Alps have increased by 2°C during the 20th Century. This “amplification” is attributed to the decrease in snow ice cover revealing darker rocks that absorb more solar radiation.\n\nA sustained heatwave was recorded through July and beginning of August. In France, 40.4 °C was recorded at the beginning of July in Ayze, a small town in the heart of the Mont Blanc massif, while 5 °C was measured at the altitude of 4000 m above Courmayeur, on the Italian side of Mont Blanc, in early August.\n\nAlpine glaciers suffer tremendously from above-normal summer temperatures.\n\nIn Switzerland, the Turtmann Glacier in the Valais Alps split in two, losing 300 000 m3 in a dramatic collapse that took place on 6 August.\n\nDaniel Farinotti, Glaciologist at ETH Zürich, Switzerland said: “The glacier retreat that we observe in the Alps does not only affect our landscapes, but also our water resources and parts of our economy. Abrupt mass loss events like the one observed at Turtmann Glacier are rare, but are illustrative for how glaciers suffer from abnormally warm summers. And the recipe for avoiding further warming is clear: we need to abate emissions. In this sense, much of the glacier's future is in our hands: it depends on the choices we make today.\"\n\nIn Italy, the Planpincieux glacier located in the Aosta Valley above Cormayeur, in the Mont Blanc massif, has been on the brink of collapse for more than 2 years. Closely monitored by Italian researchers in collaboration with Fondazione Montagna Sicura, the glacier sped up to reach velocities over more than 1 m per day at the beginning of August, prompting the evacuation of the nearby hotels and houses. More than 500 000 m3 of ice were gradually peeling off from the main body of the glacier, but eventually did not collapse.\n\n“Like in 2019, also in this year a large volume of ice moved fast and threatened the Planpincieux village. Presently, after the speed-up of the beginning of August, the situation appears less critical, but we are continuously monitoring the glacier to survey its evolution because the large fracture above the unstable portion still exists and further acceleration might occur,” said Niccolò Dematteis from IRPI (Research Institute for Hydrogeological Protection) in Italy.\n\n\n\nPersistent heavy precipitation, caused the Jinwuco moraine lake in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to break on June 25, 2020, causing significant damage\n\nAffected by the persistent heavy precipitation in Jiali County since late May, the Jinwuco moraine-dammed lake in Niwu Township, Jiali County, Tibet Autonomous Region burst on June 25, 2020. Remote sensing images show that there were a large number of ice/snow/rock avalanches falling into the glacier lake on 21 June. The day following the outburst, the flood peak reached the downstream Niwu Township, releasing over 7 million cubic meters of water in the valley, and causing casualties and destroying infrastructure, according to Shijin Wang, Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe summer of 2020 will leave a deep wound in the cryosphere. The calving of the Milne Ice Shelf, the collapse of Turtmann glacier and the threatening acceleration of the Planpincieux glacier remind us of the sensibility of the cryosphere to climate changes. These extreme mass losses cannot be replenished under the current climate, and might become more frequent in the future if emissions of greenhouse gases remain unabated.\n\nThe floods resulting from the outburst of glacier lakes are becoming an increased factor of high-risk in many parts of the world, putting at risk people and infrastructure. This is a worrisome trend and emphasize the need for sustained risk management and adaptation measures supported by a good understanding of rapid changes in these environments.\n\nWMO’s is playing an increasingly active role in the cryosphere domain as the changing environments have increased the demand for sustained services in polar and high-mountain areas and downstream, globally, the accuracy of which depend on the integration of actionable information on the state of the cryosphere.\n\nExperience has shown that polar and many mountain regions have remained insufficiently monitored, due to high costs, difficult access, extreme operating conditions, insufficient technical and operational local capacity, absence of, or weak institutional mandates. Insufficient data exchange mechanisms across sectors continue to hamper the development of hydro-meteorological and climate services, for polar and mountain regions, where existing data sources are underutilized or lost due to fragmentation across multiple operators and the lack of harmonized data policies.\n\nAs an activity of WMO, Global Cryosphere Watch is uniquely positioned to build on the traditional convening role of WMO and to foster international coordination and partnerships between scientific and operational communities and between scientists and practitioners, to enable the delivery of necessary services, sustainably, by leveraging the advances in understanding the role of the cryosphere in the Earth system.\n\nPrepared by Heidi Sevestre (International Cryosphere Climate Initiative) and with contributions from Thorsteinn Thorsteinsson (Icelandic Meteorological Office), Shijin Wang (Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, CAS, China), Adrienne White (Canadian Ice Service), Jana Eichel (Department of Physical Geography, Utrecht University, Netherlands), Daniel Farinotti (ETH Zurich, Switerland) and Niccolò Dematteis (IRPI, Italy)\n  "}
