Close engagement on the part of regulators and policymakers with the industry, including institutional investors and lenders, ratings and index providers, and international standard setters, will be critical.\nThe different methodologies used vary in scope and tend to have low transparency, with few generally accepted, consistent, comparable and verifiable indicators on which to base assessments. In practice, this means that a company might achieve a high ESG score from one service provider, and a much lower score from another.\nThis fragmentation and lack of comparability means investors cannot properly assess companies’ performance on ESG-related investment goals, such as limiting exposure to carbon emissions. This means that current practices cannot be relied on to manage climate transition risks and to green the financial system, at a time when these are rising priorities for investors and policymakers alike.\nFragmented ESG frameworks and inconsistent disclosure requirements also mean that both institutional investors and corporates cannot properly communicate on their ESG-related decisions, strategies and performance criteria, with beneficiaries and shareholders. This in turn makes it hard for such beneficiaries to assess how their savings are used, and for companies to attract financing at a competitive cost that fully considers ESG factors.\nMarket supervisors have a big role to play by encouraging greater relevance and clarity in reporting frameworks for ESG disclosures. This includes transparency on how metrics are calculated, weighted and interpreted in the assessments of ESG performance.\nMost urgent, according to the Outlook, is the development of a common set of global principles and guidelines for consistent, comparable and verifiable ESG data.\nThe report also highlights other priorities for boosting ESG investing. These include putting in place guidelines to enable banks to scale up ESG integration and due diligence in their lending; the role state enterprise ownership should play in driving better ESG outcomes; and ensuring fiduciaries such as asset managers and boards better manage material ESG risk, including when investments are exposed to longer-term sustainability risks, as in the case of infrastructure financing.\nAlso released today by the OECD’s New Approaches to Economic Challenges (NAEC) team, The Financial System brings together a range of experts to discuss how to improve financial resilience.\n\nFor further information, journalists are invited to contact Spencer Wilson in the OECD Media Office (+33 1 45 24 97 00).\n\nWorking with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.\n\nRelated Documents\n\n"},

To-date, TIWB assistance has delivered more than USD 537 million in additional revenue for developing countries up to June 2020, according to its latest annual report.\n\nThe report was presented today by OECD Secretary-General, Angel Gurría, and United Nations Development Programme Administrator, Achim Steiner, during a ministerial panel discussion in the margins of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly. The meeting was co-hosted by the Permanent Mission of Finland to the United Nations, the OECD and UNDP.\n\nWith programmes across Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, the TIWB initiative has 80 completed and ongoing programmes in 45 countries and jurisdictions worldwide. An additional 19 programmes have been requested and are in the pipeline. The report notes strong support from a broad range of partners, including regional and international organisations, as well as key donors of official development assistance (ODA). Sixteen countries have deployed their serving tax officials to provide hands-on, learning-by-doing assistance to auditors in developing countries. Among the partner administrations are those engaged in South-South co-operation including India, Kenya, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa.\n\nThe success of the current TIWB model has also triggered the expansion of the initiative on tax crime investigations and the use of information exchanged automatically between governments, both of which will help fight Illicit Financial Flows. New programmes will also cover tax treaty negotiations, the extractives and environmental tax issues.\n\n\"Despite the constraints that the COVID-19 crisis has imposed, the TIWB initiative remains fully 'open for business' thanks to measures instituted to support experts in continuing to deliver assistance remotely,\" said OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría. \"Not only are we open, but we are extending the TIWB focus to provide support in other areas of taxation to fight against corruption and promote integrity.\"\n\n\"Tax Inspectors Without Borders is playing a key role in helping developing countries to recover from the pandemic - their new service aims at increasing domestic revenues while supporting the transition to greener, more sustainable economies,\" said Mr Steiner, UNDP Administrator.\n\nIn his address to the meeting, H.E. Ville Skinnari, Finland's Minister for Development Co-operation and Foreign Trade, said \"I congratulate UNDP, OECD and the wider UN-system to promote tax justice and domestic resource mobilisation. We have done our homework in Finland, too: In June this year we launched Government of Finland's new Taxation for Development Action Programme.\"\n\nTo lead TIWB into this new phase of expansion, the Former Vice Minister of Finance of Georgia, Ms. Rusudan Kemularia, has been appointed Head of the TIWB Secretariat. Prior to joining the OECD, Ms. Kemularia also worked as a Rector of the Finance Academy, Head of the Legal and Financial Policy Departments, Secretary to the Parliament, and Co-Chair of the Tax Dispute Resolution Counsel from 2008-2019 in Georgia.\n\n\nFor further information, please contact the TIWB Secretariat or Lawrence Speer in the OECD Media Office (+33 1 45 24 79 70), or Sangita Khadka at UNDP (+1 212 906 5043).\n\n\nRelated Documents\n\n"},

These markets must now be mobilised to support a resilient, dynamic and sustainable recovery, according to a new OECD report.\nThe OECD Capital Market Review of Portugal offers Portuguese authorities policy recommendations that can help to strengthen capital markets to finance corporations of all sizes and provide investment opportunities to savers.\nThe improved economic conditions in the country over the recent years have not translated into a rise in the use of capital market financing by Portuguese companies. At the end of 2019, there were only 47 companies listed on the Portuguese stock market, only a third of the number listed back in 1997. Instead, companies heavily rely on bank financing, with very few using long-term bond markets. The picture for private capital markets is similar. In 2019, the Portuguese share of European private equity investments was less than half of its share in the GDP of the European Union.\n“Years of low activity have severely weakened Portugal’s capital market ecosystem,” said OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría, presenting the report with Portugal’s Finance Minister João Leão and EU Commissioner Elisa Ferreira. “Minor adjustments are not sufficient. And together with the authorities concerned, the Portuguese government is well prepared to undertake a broad range of policy initiatives to boost domestic capital markets. This will help Portugal to build a more diverse, innovative and resilient business sector that can thrive in the post-COVID world.”\nAn important impediment to the development of Portuguese capital markets is the low savings ratio of households and a limited allocation of savings to capital market securities. Since 2000, the aggregate net savings of Portuguese households have been among the lowest in the European Union. Importantly, households allocated almost half of their savings to bank deposits, compared to around one third in France and Italy. Providing households with attractive investment opportunities, directly or through collective investment vehicles, will give them more choice when managing their savings and better opportunities to share the wealth creation of the Portuguese business sector.\nThe report notes that the dominance of small firms with low productivity holds back Portugal’s ability to move further towards high value-added knowledge-based production and competitiveness. More active capital markets could play an important role in helping corporations to grow, increasing the pool of investible companies and facilitating the process of consolidation.\nThe OECD Capital Market Review of Portugal, with main findings and recommendations, is accessible at http://www.oecd.org/corporate/oecd-capital-market-review-portugal.htm/.\nThe project was funded by the European Union via the Structural Reform Support Programme and implemented by the OECD, in co-operation with the European Commission’s Directorate General for Structural Reform Support (DG REFORM).\nFor further information, journalists can contact the OECD Media Office (tel. + 33 1 45 24 97 00).\n\nWorking with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.\n\nRelated Documents\n\n"},

But a new OECD PISA report reveals wide disparities both between and within countries in the availability of technology in schools and of teachers’ capacities to use ICT effectively.\nEffective Policies, Successful Schools analyses findings from the most recent OECD PISA 2018 test, involving around 600,000 15-year-old students in 79 countries and economies.\nOn average across OECD countries in 2018, there was almost one computer available at school for educational purposes for every 15-year-old student. Yet in many countries school principals reported that the computers were not powerful enough in terms of computing capacity, affecting one in three students globally.\n“This crisis has exposed the many inadequacies and inequities in education systems across the world,” said Andreas Schleicher, OECD Director for Education and Skills. “Disadvantaged young people have been particularly affected and every country should do more to ensure that all schools have the resources they need so that every student has an equal opportunity to learn and succeed.”\nDifferences between advantaged and disadvantaged schools were significant. In Brazil 68% of students in advantaged schools had access to sufficiently powerful digital devices, according to principals, compared to just 10% of students in disadvantaged schools. In Spain, there was a 40 percentage-point difference (70% vs. 30%) in the availability of sufficiently powerful digital devices between advantaged and disadvantaged schools.\nTeachers’ capacity to use technology varies widely. On average across OECD countries, 65% of 15-year-olds were enrolled in schools whose principal reported that teachers have the necessary technical and pedagogical skills to integrate digital devices in instruction. The proportion varied considerably between socio-economically advantaged and disadvantaged schools. In Sweden, for example, 89% of students in advantaged schools attended such a school, but only 54% of students in disadvantaged schools did.\nOn average across OECD countries, about 60% of 15-year-old students were enrolled in schools whose principal reported that teachers have sufficient time to prepare lessons integrating digital devices, ranging from close to 90% of students in the four Chinese provinces/municipalities that participated in PISA 2018 to little more than 10% of students in Japan.\nFor some students, even the basics for learning are not available at home. On average across OECD countries, 9% of 15-year-old students do not have a quiet place to study in their home. Even in PISA top-performer Korea, one in five students from the 25% most disadvantaged schools reported they do not have a place to study at home, compared to one in 10 students in advantaged schools.\nThe report also compares other key aspects of school policies and equity. Overall, the PISA 2018 results reveal considerable disparities between advantaged and disadvantaged schools related to shortages of education staff and material resources, including digital resources. PISA shows that, already prior to the pandemic, many schools faced shortages in resources. On average across OECD countries, 27% of students were enrolled in schools whose principal said that learning is hindered by a lack of teaching staff, and shortages of staff tended to be reported far more often by principals of disadvantaged schools (in 42 education systems) and by principals of public schools (in another 42 education systems). In 44 education systems, students attending schools whose principal reported greater shortages of teaching and support staff scored lower in reading.\nEnsuring that all schools have adequate and high-quality resources, and the appropriate support, is key if students from all backgrounds are to be given equal opportunities to learn and succeed at school, according to the report.\nThe findings also reveal how the foundations for education success are laid early. Students who had attended pre-primary education for longer scored better in PISA than students who had not attended pre-primary education. Between 2015 and 2018, the share of 15-year-old students who had attended pre-primary school for three years increased in 28 countries. Despite this advantage, in 68 out of 78 education systems with comparable data, students who had not attended pre-primary education were much more likely to be socio-economically disadvantaged and enrolled in more disadvantaged schools at the age of 15. This highlights how access to pre-primary education often reinforces educational disparities. When expanding pre-primary education, greater care must be taken to shift the emphasis from access to quality and from care to education, says the report.\nThe report is available at http://www.oecd.org/education/pisa-2018-results-volume-v-ca768d40-en.htm.\nFor more information, journalists should contact Spencer Wilson in the OECD Media Office (tel. + 33 1 45 24 81 18).\n\nWorking with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.\n\nRelated Documents\n\n"},

But some of these gains may be erased by the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout, according to a new OECD report.", "detail": "19/10/2020 -\nMigration flows have increased over the past decade and some progress has been made to improve the integration of immigrants in the host countries. But some of these gains may be erased by the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout. Governments need to secure the health and safety of all workers in essential activities and maintain spending on integration to help migrants continue to contribute to society and the economy, according to a new OECD report.\nThe OECD International Migration Outlook 2020 says that the COVID-19 crisis has had unprecedented consequences on migration flows. Before the pandemic, permanent migration flows to the OECD amounted to 5.3 million in 2019, with similar figures for 2017 and 2018. Although there were fewer refugee admissions, permanent labour migration rose by more than 13% in 2019 and temporary labour migration also rose, with more than 5 million entries recorded in the OECD.\nFollowing the onset of the pandemic, almost all OECD countries restricted admission to foreigners.\nAs a result, issuances of new visas and permits in OECD countries plummeted by 46% in the first half of 2020, compared with the same period in 2019. This is the largest drop ever recorded. In the second quarter, the decline was 72%. Overall, 2020 is expected to be a historical low for international migration in the OECD area.\nThere are strong signs that mobility will not return to previous levels for some time. This is due to weaker labour demand, persistent severe travel restrictions as well as the widespread use of teleworking among high-skilled workers and remote learning by students.\n“Migration will continue to play an important role for economic growth and innovation, as well as in responding to rapidly changing labour markets,” said OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría, launching the report with European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson. “We need to avoid rolling back on integration and reaffirm that migration is an integral part of our lives.”\nMigrant workers have been on the frontline of the crisis. They account for a large share of the OECD medical workforce, with one in four medical doctors in the OECD, and one in six nurses. In many OECD countries, more than a third of the workforce in other key sectors, such as transport, cleaning, food manufacturing and IT services, are immigrants.\nYet immigrants are facing a hard time in the labour market. Much of the past decade’s progress in employment rates among immigrants has been wiped out by the pandemic. In all countries for which data are available, immigrants’ unemployment increased more, compared to their native-born peers. The largest increases for immigrants were observed in Canada, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United States. In Sweden, almost 60% of the initial increase in unemployment fell on immigrants. In the United States, unemployment of immigrants was lower than their native-born peers by almost one percentage point before the pandemic, it is now 2 percentage points higher.\nMigrants are highly exposed to the health impacts of the pandemic as a result of working on the frontline during the pandemic but also vulnerabilities linked, for example, to housing conditions and poverty. Studies in a number of OECD countries found an infection risk that is at least twice as high as that of the native-born.\nGoing forward, getting migration and integration policies right will be essential if we are to achieve a strong and truly inclusive recovery.\nRead the OECD International Migration Outlook 2020and the accompanying report.\nFor more information, journalists should contact the OECD Media Office (tel. + 33 1 45 24 97 00).\nBrowse through all OECD contributions on tackling COVID-19\n\nWorking with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.\n\nRelated Documents\n\n"},

They identified remaining political and technical issues where differences of views remain to be bridged, and next steps in the multilateral process.\nParticipants approved for public consultation a new Blueprint for Pillar One of the project, which would establish new rules on where tax should be paid (“nexus” rules) and a fundamentally new way of sharing taxing rights between countries. The aim is ensure that digitally-intensive or consumer-facing Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) pay taxes where they conduct sustained and significant business, even when they do not have a physical presence, as is currently required under existing tax rules.\nParticipants also approved for public consultation a new Blueprint for Pillar Two of the project, which would introduce a global minimum tax that would help countries around the world address remaining issues linked to base erosion and profit shifting by MNEs.\nThe absence of a consensus-based solution, on the other hand, could lead to a proliferation of unilateral digital services taxes and an increase in damaging tax and trade disputes, which would undermine tax certainty and investment, the OECD said. Under a worst-case scenario – a global trade war triggered by unilateral digital services taxes worldwide - the failure to reach agreement could reduce global GDP by more than 1% annually.\n“It is clear that new rules are urgently needed to ensure fairness and equity in our tax systems, and to adapt the international tax architecture to new and changing business models. Without a global, consensus-based solution, the risk of further uncoordinated, unilateral measures is real, and growing by the day,” said OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría. “It is imperative that we take this work across the finish line. Failure would risk tax wars turning into trade wars at a time when the global economy is already suffering enormously.”\nA new economic impact analysis released today shows the combined effect of the two-pillar solution under discussion. Up to 4% of global corporate income tax (CIT) revenues, or USD 100 billion of revenue gains annually, could result from implementation of the global minimum tax under Pillar Two. The analysis also shows that a further USD 100 billion could be redistributed to market jurisdictions through Pillar One plans to ensure a fairer international tax framework.\nThe ongoing work will be presented in a new OECD Secretary-General Tax Report and discussed during the next meeting of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, under the Saudi Arabian Presidency, on 14 October.\nFor more information on the OECD/G20 BEPS Project, and to access a highlights brochure and FAQs, visit:www.oecd.org/tax/beps/beps-actions/action1/.\nA one-hour live webcast will provide further details today, Monday 12 October at 15:00 CEST, during which experts from the OECD's Centre for Tax Policy and Administration will present these latest updates and answer questions.

No foreign bribery case has been detected, investigated or prosecuted since the Phase 4 report. In particular, the Working Group is concerned that Finland’s high acquittal rate in foreign bribery cases may have discouraged law enforcement authorities and prosecutors to continue to take all necessary steps to detect, investigate and prosecute this offence.\nThe Working Group thus calls on Finland to urgently step up its enforcement efforts. As part of these efforts, Finland should urgently provide additional detailed written information and training to investigators, prosecutors and judges on the requirements of the foreign bribery offence under the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, as recommended by the Working Group in the Phase 4 report (recommendations 3a and 3b). These recommendations aim to address the Working Group’s concerns about the courts’ interpretation of the foreign bribery offence and, to a lesser extent, investigators’ and prosecutors’ understanding of the evidence required to prove the offence, in the foreign bribery cases that resulted in acquittals. The Working Group notes that Finland has taken an important number of initiatives aimed at implementing these recommendations. However, while acknowledging the complexity of the issue, and the need to protect the fundamental principle of judiciary independence, the Working Group regrets that Finland has not been able to provide sufficiently detailed and comprehensive information on the foreign bribery offence to the whole range of relevant practitioners, including judges.\nThe Working Group on Bribery stands ready to support the sharing of experiences between Finland and other member countries that have faced similar challenges.\nFinland will report back to the OECD Working Group on Bribery in October 2021 on further efforts made to address these issues (enforcement efforts, and implementation of recommendations 3a and 3b), as well as on steps taken to implement the longstanding recommendation on amending legislation to provide clear, comprehensive protections for whistleblowers (recommendation 1b).\nFor further information, journalists are invited to contact Daisy Pelham of the OECD Anti-Corruption Division (+33 (0) 1 45 24 90 81) or the OECD Media Division (+33 (0)1 45 24 97 00).\nFor more information on the implementation of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention in Finland, please visit: http://www.oecd.org/corruption/anti-bribery/finland-oecdanti-briberyconvention.htm.\nWorking with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.\n\nRelated Documents\n\n"},

The key ingredients have been commitments by employers not to fire workers while unions accept shortening working times and a lowering of wages. Governments have then stepped in with benefits or wage subsidies to make up for the wage shortfalls.\nSuch agreements can help shore up consumer confidence by keeping workers in jobs and maintaining incomes. The report looks at how such arrangements have worked in a number of countries, including in Germany, Italy and France. In Denmark, the job retention scheme managed to limit the rise in unemployment to 0.1 percentage point between February and May 2020. In Korea, social partners agreed to lift the employment retention subsidy from 63% to 75% with additional emergency support available for small businesses and workers on non-standard contracts.\nThe report points to the importance of involving all social partners in ensuring safe working conditions during the pandemic, particularly as individual workers may be even more reluctant to voice their concerns during the crisis for fear of losing their jobs. Social dialogue provides a forum to understand workers’ concerns and negotiate balanced approaches.\nPresenting the report alongside ILO Director-General Guy Ryder and Swedish Trade Minister Anna Hallberg, OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría said, “Social dialogue has shaped the policies that supported workers and sustained the economy, helping to boost confidence during the crisis. Social dialogue’s importance is not limited to the immediate management of the crisis. It also helps countries to meet their UN 2030 Agenda commitments and prepare for global trends such as digitalisation, globalisation and climate change.”\nWith many of the essential ‘frontline’ workers on low wages, such as those in healthcare, food processing, or for instance supermarket cashiers, setting appropriate minimum wages via statutory provisions and/or collective bargaining and achieving balanced decisions through social dialogue can improve standards of living. Fairness and equity will result in a more resilient labour market and a stronger economic recovery, the report says.\nBeyond the challenges brought by the COVID-19 crisis, labour markets are having to adapt to technological change creating a demand for new skills. The report says clear policies and mechanisms are needed to promote lifelong learning and skills development. Social dialogue is needed at national, sectoral and firm level, and involving workers in the decisions can facilitate effective adoption of the skills development programmes.\nThe report is available at www.theglobaldeal.com/social-dialogue-skills-and-covid-19.pdf.

Students from 27 countries and economies took the test. Students, teachers, parents and school principals from around 66 countries and economies completed a questionnaire*.\nThe results reveal a gender gap in access to opportunities to learn global competence as well as in students’ global and intercultural skills and attitudes. On average across OECD countries, boys were more likely than girls to report taking part in activities where they are expected to express and discuss their views, while girls were more likely than boys to report taking part in activities related to intercultural understanding and communication.\nBoys, for example, were more likely to learn about the interconnectedness of countries’ economies, look for news on the Internet or watch the news together during class. They were also more likely to be asked by teachers to give their opinion about international news, take part in classroom discussions about world events and analyse global issues with their classmates.\nIn contrast, girls were more likely than boys to report that they learn how to solve conflicts with their peers in the classroom, learn about different cultures and learn how people from different cultures can have different perspectives on some issues. These gender differences could reflect personal interests and self-efficacy but could also reflect how girls and boys are socialised at home and at school, according to the report.\n“Education is key to helping young people navigate today’s increasingly complex and interconnected world,” said Andreas Schleicher, OECD Director for Education and Skills. “The schools and education systems that are most successful in fostering global knowledge, skills and attitudes among young people are those that offer a curriculum that values openness to the world, provide a positive and inclusive learning environment and offer opportunities to relate to people from other cultures.”\nThe findings reveal the key role teachers play in promoting and integrating intercultural understanding into their classroom practices and lessons. Most teachers reported that they are confident in their ability to teach in multicultural settings. But the lack of adequate professional development opportunities in this field is a major challenge. Few teachers reported having received training on teaching in multicultural or multilingual settings.\nMore than 90% of students attended schools where principals reported positive multicultural beliefs among their teachers. Yet students who perceive discrimination by their teachers towards immigrants and people from other cultural backgrounds, for example, exhibited similar negative attitudes. This highlights the key role of teachers and school principals in countering or perpetuating discrimination by acting as role models.\nThe report found a strong link between students learning activities at school and having more positive intercultural attitudes. Also, speaking two or more languages was positively associated with awareness of global issues, interest in learning about other cultures, respect for people from other cultures and positive attitudes towards immigrants.\nOn average across OECD countries, 50% of students reported learning two or more languages at school, 38% reported learning one foreign language and only 12% reported not learning any foreign language at school. The largest share of students (more than 20%) who reported not learning any foreign language at school were observed in Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia and Scotland. By contrast, in 42 countries, more than 90% of students reported that they learn at least one foreign language at school.\nThe report is available at http://www.oecd.org/education/pisa-2018-results-volume-vi-d5f68679-en.htm.\nJournalists are invited to contact Andreas Schleicher (tel. + 33 1 45 24 93 66) in the OECD’s Education and Skills Directorate or the OECD’s Media Division (tel. + 33 1 45 24 97 00).\n\n*Notes to editors:\nParticipating countries and economies in the test: Albania, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Greece, Hong Kong (China), Indonesia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Morocco, Panama, Philippines, The Russian Federation, Scotland (United Kingdom), Serbia, Singapore, The Slovak Republic, Spain, Chinese Taipei and Thailand.\nThe countries/economies that took the student’s global competence questionnaire only are: Albania, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Baku (Azerbaijan), Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong (China), Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Kosovo, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Macao (China), Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Panama, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, The Republic of Moldova, Romania, The Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Scotland (United Kingdom), Serbia, Singapore, The Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, The United Arab Emirates, Uruguay and Viet Nam.\n\nWorking with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.\n\nRelated Documents\n\n"},

Señalaron los problemas políticos y técnicos en los que todavía existen diferencias de opinión que se han de solventar, y los próximos pasos a seguir en el proceso multilateral.\nLos participantes aprobaron presentar a consulta pública un nuevo Plan General del Pilar Uno del proyecto, que establecería nuevas normas sobre el lugar en el que deberían pagarse los impuestos (normas sobre el «nexo») y una manera totalmente nueva de compartir las potestades tributarias entre países. El objetivo es garantizar que las empresas multinacionales con un fuerte componente digital u orientadas al consumidor paguen impuestos en el lugar en el que operan de manera sostenida y significativa, aunque no tengan presencia física, como se exige actualmente en virtud de la normativa tributaria vigente.\nLos participantes también aprobaron presentar a consulta pública un nuevo Plan General del Pilar Dos del proyecto, que establecería un impuesto mínimo mundial que ayudaría a los países de todo el mundo a resolver el resto de los problemas relacionados con la erosión de la base imponible y el traslado de beneficios por parte de las empresas multinacionales.\nPor otra parte, según la OCDE, la falta de una solución consensuada podría dar lugar a la proliferación de impuestos unilaterales sobre servicios digitales y un aumento de litigios nocivos en materia comercial y tributaria, que menoscabarían la certidumbre fiscal y la inversión. Si no se llega a un acuerdo, en la hipótesis más pesimista —una guerra comercial a nivel global a causa de los impuestos unilaterales sobre los servicios digitales establecidos en todo el mundo—, el PIB mundial podría disminuir más de un 1% al año.\nEl Secretario General de la OCDE, Angel Gurría, afirmó: «Está claro que es necesario aprobar urgentemente nuevas normas para garantizar la justicia y la equidad de nuestros sistemas tributarios y para adaptar la arquitectura fiscal internacional a modelos empresariales nuevos y cambiantes. Si no se logra una solución mundial consensuada, el riesgo de que aumente la descoordinación y unilateralidad de las medidas será real, y aumentará progresivamente. Es imprescindible que completemos este trabajo. Si no lo hacemos, se corre el riesgo de que las guerras de impuestos se transformen en guerras comerciales en un momento en el que la economía mundial ya se está resintiendo considerablemente.»\nUn nuevo análisis del impacto económico publicado hoy muestra el efecto combinado de la solución basada en los dos pilares que se está examinando. Hasta un 4% de los ingresos mundiales derivados del impuesto sobre la renta de las sociedades (ISR), o 100000 millones de dólares estadounidenses de recaudación adicional anual, podrían derivar de la implementación del impuesto mínimo mundial previsto en el Pilar Dos. El análisis también muestra que podrían redistribuirse otros 100000 millones de dólares estadounidenses a las jurisdicciones a través de los planes del Pilar Uno para garantizar un marco fiscal internacional más justo.\nEl trabajo en curso se presentará en un nuevo Informe Fiscal del Secretario General de la OCDE y se debatirá durante la próxima reunión de los ministros de finanzas del G20 y los gobernadores de los bancos centrales que se celebrará el 14 de octubre bajo la presidencia de la Arabia Saudita.\nPara obtener más información sobre el Proyecto BEPS OECD/G20 y tener acceso al folleto con la información más sobresaliente y preguntas frecuentes, visita: http://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/beps-actions/action1/.\nEl lunes 12 de octubre a las 15:00 CEST, los expertos del Centro de Política y Administración Tributaria de la OCDE presentarán una actualización con más detalles y responderán preguntas a través de una videoconferencia en vivo con duración de una hora.

Ramping up investment in the digital economy, the service sector, green infrastructure and adult skills would strengthen the recovery and help to boost productivity and environmental sustainability for the long term, according to a new OECD report.\nThe latest OECD Economic Survey of the United Kingdom underlines the importance of the emergency support measures put in place to address the coronavirus crisis, but also stresses the need to address longer-term challenges. Active labour market spending for displaced and low-skilled workers should be increased to help workers in sectors with uncertain futures move into quality jobs, and infrastructure spending should focus on the most deprived regions. Low interest rates mean there is room for more stimulus, if needed. Public investment should build on existing efforts to revive productivity growth and transition to a low-carbon economy.\n“The combination of COVID-19 and the exit from the EU Single Market makes the UK outlook exceptionally uncertain. Actions taken to address the pandemic and decisions made on future trading relationships will have a lasting impact on the UK’s economic trajectory for years to come, so they should be in line with long-term objectives,” said OECD Chief Economist Laurence Boone. “Productivity growth in service sectors will have to accelerate significantly for the recovery to be long-lasting and sustainable.”\nThe coronavirus crisis erupted against a background of subdued growth, stagnant productivity and flat investment in the United Kingdom and triggered one of the most severe falls in output of OECD countries, reflecting the economy’s deep integration in the world economy and the fact that the hard-hit service sector makes up around 80% of UK output and employment.\nWhile a rapid and massive emergency response has helped to steady the economy, the United Kingdom still faces a prolonged period of disruption to economic activity, which risks exacerbating pre-existing inequalities and regional disparities. Most households have reported a drop in income since the crisis. Economic activity will only recover gradually, with several years of high unemployment likely due to business closures and delayed investment. The Survey, assuming a smooth transition to an EU Free Trade Agreement, projects an unprecedented fall in GDP in 2020 of 10.1%, with activity still below its pre-crisis level by the end of 2021. The unemployment rate is projected to be 7.1% in 2021, up from 3.8% in 2019.\nLeaving the EU Single Market at the end of year will require firms to adapt. Avoiding a “no deal” outcome would benefit both the United Kingdom and the European Union. Were there to be an EU exit with no free trade deal, the government should be ready to provide targeted support for affected firms and workers and put in place trade facilitation measures to smooth disruptions at the border.\nWhile the increase in barriers to trade resulting from any form of exit from the EU Single Market will lower growth over the medium term, a disorderly exit would be more costly and disruptive. Managing a disorderly exit would be complicated by the fact that firms have diverted their attention to dealing with COVID-19, and those with reduced earnings will be less able to invest in new systems, staff and training.\nThe UK’s Industrial Strategy should help to revive productivity growth – which is key to sustaining jobs and wage growth – yet more could still be done to encourage innovation and reduce gaps in adopting new technology between leading firms and laggards. Overall public investment has been lower than in other leading economies in recent years, and investment in digital infrastructure still lags investment in transport, energy and utilities. These are all areas where the UK lags the best-performing OECD countries and which are likely to bring high productivity gains. Planned spending to improve digital skills could also be more ambitious, as the COVID-19 crisis makes the low level of adult training in the United Kingdom a more urgent concern.\nSee an Overview of the UK Survey with key findings and charts (this link can be included in media articles).\nFor further information, journalists are invited to contact Catherine Bremer in the OECD Media Office (+33 1 45 24 97 00).\n\nWorking with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.\n\nRelated Documents\n\n"},

No trabalho de contenção da crise da COVID-19, para o Brasil, como para o resto do mundo, intensificar o ritmo da transformação digital pode acelerar e reforçar a recuperação, de acordo com a OCDE.\n\n“As tecnologias digitais são o alicerce das economias atuais, e as ferramentas digitais e a conectividade têm se revelado essenciais para ajudar empresas e pessoas a resistirem à crise da COVID-19”, declarou o Secretário-Geral da OCDE, Angel Gurría, que divulga duas Avaliações simultâneas sobre a transformação digital no Brasil e seus setores de telecomunicações e radiodifusão. “Enquanto o Brasil e o mundo trabalham para enfrentar essa crise devastadora, deve-se fazer de tudo para aproveitar as oportunidades oferecidas pela digitalização de modo a fortalecer a recuperação e construir uma economia futura resiliente e inclusiva”.\n\nA Avaliação da transformação digital no país, intitulada A Caminho da Era Digital no Brasil, conclui que, apesar dos recentes avanços, o Brasil está atrasado no investimento em inovação digital e no nível de capacitação digital da mão de obra. A Avaliação recomenda formas de aumentar a adoção das tecnologias digitais entre pessoas e empresas, fortalecer a segurança digital e a privacidade e estimular a inovação. Ela recomenda uma melhor coordenação das políticas de transformação digital entre ministérios e agências governamentais e maiores recursos para a Estratégia Brasileira de Transformação Digital (E-Digital).\n\nUm relatório paralelo, intitulado Avaliação da OCDE sobre Telecomunicações e Radiodifusão no Brasil 2020, mostra como o Brasil pode alcançar economias desenvolvidas no acesso a serviços de comunicação de alta qualidade, os quais são fundamentais para uma transformação digital inclusiva e bem-sucedida. A Avaliação sugere ações nas áreas de comunicação e radiodifusão para melhorar as condições de mercado, a concorrência e o arcabouço de política pública e regulação. A Avaliação também recomenda uma reforma fundamental da estrutura de impostos, os quais tanto limitam o potencial de investimento e inovação dos operadores nesses setores. \n\nEm vista da crescente convergência dos serviços de comunicação e radiodifusão, a criação de uma agência reguladora unificada independente para esses setores, como tantos outros países fizeram, ajudaria a baixar os preços e melhorar a qualidade dos serviços, afirma a Avaliação. Do mesmo modo, introduzir um regime de licenciamento simplificado, baseado em uma licença única para os dois setores, reduziria os custos jurídicos e os encargos administrativos para os operadores. Além disso, o futuro leilão do espectro 5G deve ser cuidadosamente desenhado para garantir uma cobertura de rede ideal e condições de concorrência.\n\nA implementação bem-sucedida de uma política digital é vital em todos os países para garantir que os benefícios da transformação digital, como o aumento da produtividade e melhoria no bem-estar, sejam compartilhados de maneira inclusiva entre economias e sociedades. As ferramentas digitais também podem ajudar a direcionar as políticas sociais de modo eficiente. Por outro lado, a implementação malsucedida da política digital pode agravar as desigualdades existentes entre indivíduos muito e pouco qualificados, grandes e pequenas empresas e regiões urbanas e rurais.\n\nEntre os avanços realizados no Brasil nos últimos anos, as assinaturas de serviços de comunicação têm aumentado continuamente, graças à triplicação das assinaturas de serviços móveis de 2012 a 2019, e aos preços relativamente acessíveis de planos de voz e dados móveis. A proporção de domicílios com acesso à Internet aumentou de 40% em 2013 para 67% em 2018 e a proporção de adultos usuários de Internet aumentou de 50% para 72%. Novas leis reforçaram a segurança digital, a proteção dos consumidores e dos dados pessoais. O Brasil criou uma estrutura institucional exemplar para a governança da Internet, o Comitê Gestor da Internet, e tomou medidas para promover a concorrência nos mercados de serviços móveis e fortalecer a independência da agência reguladora de telecomunicações.\n\nApesar deste progresso, desafios subsistem. Por exemplo, quase um quarto dos adultos brasileiros nunca tinha utilizado a Internet até 2018. Os dados também mostram que o uso da Internet está fortemente relacionado aos níveis de escolaridade, renda e idade. Existe uma exclusão digital persistente entre populações urbanas e rurais, com 75% da população adulta em áreas urbanas utilizando a Internet contra apenas 49% nas zonas rurais.\n\nA banda larga fixa é menos acessível no Brasil do que a móvel. Enquanto o Brasil tinha 90 assinaturas de banda larga móvel a cada 100 habitantes em junho de 2019, não muito atrás da média da OCDE de 113, a penetração da banda larga fixa de 16% constitui apenas metade da média da OCDE, de 31%. Apenas 54% das empresas com 10 ou mais empregados tinham um site em 2019, em comparação com a média da OCDE de 78%. Além disso, ainda que o comércio eletrônico venha crescendo, apenas 21% das empresas realizaram vendas on-line em 2019.\n\nResumo das principais recomendações das duas Avaliações:\n\n\n\n\nNota aos Editores:\n\nA OCDE com sede em Paris é uma organização internacional que promove políticas para melhorar o bem-estar econômico e social das pessoas em todo o mundo.

If managed sustainably, the ocean could have the capacity to regenerate, be more productive, and support more prosperous societies. This will require governments to support those sectors less equipped to foster sustainable ocean economies by facilitating their access to finance and policy evidence.\n“More than 3 billion people rely on the ocean for their livelihoods, and we are all dependent on it for supporting ecosystems, providing food and regulating the climate. Yet human activity is causing long-lasting and in some cases irreversible damage to it,” said OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría. “It is crucial that we invest in ocean-related sectors in a way that fosters environmental and economic sustainability and puts people’s well-being at the centre, especially as we shape the recovery from COVID-19.”\nNoting that the poorest countries tend to be both the most exposed to the effects of ocean degradation and the least equipped to respond, the report calls for co-ordinated action and more effective international development co-operation to improve sustainability of the ocean economy. The United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, starting in 2021, should foster greater use of science and innovation to develop sustainable practices in a post-COVID world.\nThe report calls on all countries to phase out government support for environmentally harmful economic activities and use instruments like fees, charges, taxes and tradable permits to discourage over-exploitation, pollution and greenhouse emissions and encourage conservation and sustainable development of ocean activities. Such instruments can also generate much-needed financing for ocean sustainability. Taxes relevant to ocean sustainability – in particular taxes on ocean-related pollution, transport and energy –generated at least USD 4 billion globally in 2018.\nThe report’s analysis of six ocean-based industries (fishing, fish farming, fish processing, shipbuilding, maritime passenger transport, and freight shipping) shows that they contributed to more than 11% of GDP in lower middle-income countries and 6% of GDP in low-income countries in 2015, compared to less than 2% of GDP for high-income countries. In some low-income or island states, key ocean-based sectors like tourism can account for over 20% of GDP.\nThis reliance leaves developing countries highly exposed to the risks of deteriorating marine ecosystems, yet less than 1% of foreign aid is spent on conserving marine ecosystems and improving sustainability of ocean-related economic activities. The USD 3 billion in official development assistance (ODA) that was allocated on average to ocean activities annually over 2013-18 has tended to focus on expanding activities like ports or shipping without including efforts to improve sustainability.\nWell-designed financing is essential to achieving sustainable ocean economies, yet data on ocean finance is scarce, and it is unclear how much of it contributes to sustainability. To help fill this gap, the report measures global development finance for the sustainable ocean economy and looks at private finance mobilised by ODA for ocean activities. It calls for environmental and social sustainability criteria relating to the ocean economy to be integrated into traditional financial services and investments, financial markets and credit markets.\nRead the reportSustainable Ocean for All: Harnessing the benefits of sustainable ocean economies for developing countries.\nAccess theOECD platform on development finance for sustainable ocean economies\nFor further information, journalists are invited to contact Catherine Bremer in the OECD Media Office (+33 1 45 24 97 00).\n\nWorking with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.\n\nRelated Documents\n\n"},

As governments start rebuilding their economies and people’s livelihoods, it is critical that long-term public spending on education remain a priority to ensure that every young person has the same opportunity to continue education, succeed at school and develop the skills they need to contribute to society, according to a new OECD report.\nEducation at a Glance 2020, together with an accompanying brochure analysing the impact of the crisis, warns that, while there is uncertainty about the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education expenditure, governments may face difficult decisions on the allocation of public funds as economic growth slows, tax incomes decline and healthcare and welfare costs rise. In 2017, total public expenditure on primary to tertiary education as a percentage of total government expenditure was 11% on average across OECD countries, with the share ranging from around 7% in Greece to around 17% in Chile.\n“Strengthening education systems needs to be at the heart of government planning to recover from this crisis and give young people the skills and competencies they need to succeed,” said OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría, launching the report in Paris. “It’s critical that every effort be made to ensure that the crisis does not exacerbate the inequalities in education that have been revealed in many countries. The current crisis has tested our ability to deal with large-scale disruptions. It is now up to us to build as its legacy a more resilient society.”\nThe crisis has hit the vocational and education training (VET) sector particularly hard. This is a major concern, according to the report, as many of the professions that formed the backbone of economic and social life during the lockdown hinge on vocational qualifications.\nOn average across OECD countries, young adults today are less likely to attain an upper secondary vocational path than their parents were and more likely to pursue an academic university degree. Earnings are also lower: adults with an upper secondary vocational qualification have similar earnings to those with an upper secondary general qualification, but they earn 34% less than tertiary-educated adults on average across OECD countries.\nGovernments should step up their efforts to make vocational education and vocational qualifications more attractive to young people. This should include enhancing work-based learning and strengthening ties with the private sector. Currently, only one third of upper secondary vocational students take part in combined school and work-based programmes on average across OECD countries.\nMaking it easier for students to move from vocational to higher education is also key and can improve learning outcomes. Upper secondary vocational students are more likely to complete their qualification when the programme provides access to tertiary education than when it does not. Today, almost seven in ten students are enrolled in programmes that, in theory, enable them to progress to higher degrees.\nThe crisis has also raised concerns around the value proposition of higher education institutions, with students reluctant to commit large amounts of time and money when much of the course work is only available online. This may affect international student mobility as students question the very value of obtaining a degree abroad.\nAny decline in enrolment of international students for the next academic year will hit the core education services universities offer, but also will indirectly affect the financial support they provide to domestic students, as well as research and development activities. While international students represent 6% of tertiary students on average across OECD countries, they represent 20% or more in Australia, Luxembourg and New Zealand. International student mobility is particularly high at doctoral level, where one out of five students on average travels abroad to earn their degree. To remain relevant, universities will need to reinvent learning environments so that digitalisation expands and complements, but does not replace, student-teacher and student-student relationships.\nEducation at a Glance provides comparable national statistics measuring the state of education worldwide. The report analyses the education systems of the OECD’s 37 member countries, as well as of Argentina, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, India, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.\nFurther information on Education at a Glance, including country notes and key data, is available at: http://www.oecd.org/education/education-at-a-glance/.\nJournalists are invited to contact OECD Director for Education and Skills Andreas Schleicher (tel. + 33 1 45 24 18 97) or the OECD’s Media Office (tel. + 33 1 45 24 97 00).\n\nWorking with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.\n\nRelated Documents\n\n"},

Growth has collapsed, unemployment is rising and more will need to be done to strengthen responses to the crisis and ensure that the recovery brings about sustainable and more inclusive development.\nThe Survey recommends a wide range of measures to improve the quality of and access to health care and support businesses and people. This includes lowering interest rates; providing temporary financial support to households and businesses; and extending financial relief in sectors hard hit by the crisis, particularly if there is a renewed virus outbreak later in the year.\nThe pandemic adds to South Africa’s long-standing challenges, the Survey says. Under a so-called double-hit scenario, a new outbreak affecting South Africa and its trading partner countries will curtail exports, deepening the recession to -8.2% in 2020, and limiting the recovery in 2021 to GDP growth of just 0.6%. In the single-hit scenario, where a second wave of the virus is avoided, economic activity will still fall by 7½percent in 2020 before picking up progressively to growth of 2½percent in 2021.\nPresenting the Survey today, OECD Economics Department Country Studies Director Alvaro Pereira said: “South Africa cannot afford to delay reforms. It is essential to undertake reforms to restore long-run fiscal sustainability and growth, while continuing to support the economy in the short run.”\nMacroeconomic and structural policies are needed to put growth on a sound footing going forward. Bold fiscal measures are needed to curb spending pressures and restore fiscal sustainability, including taking steps to reduce the government wage bill and transfers to state-owned enterprises. Structural policy reforms to boost competition, restructure state-owned enterprises, improve the regulatory framework and improve public investment in transport infrastructure, skills and education are also called for.\nThe pandemic has demonstrated that further action is needed to build an inclusive social protection system. The Survey suggests South Africa consider additional means-tested support for households below the food poverty line, better coverage for informal workers and a gradual increase to the public financing of health care, through a form of public insurance.\nThe tourism sector was hit hard by the pandemic and resulting containment measures, yet it has good potential to contribute to the economy and future employment growth, the Survey said. Implementation of electronic visa programmes for emerging target markets and increasing the number of countries falling under the visa-waiver agreement will boost arrivals, while a reduction of red tape and regulatory burden for entrepreneurs and small enterprises will improve market access. Investments in transport and tourism infrastructure have to be aligned to connect tourists to places.\nSee an Overview of the Survey with key findings and charts (this link can be included in media articles).\nFor further information, journalists are invited to contact the OECD Media Office (+33 1 4524 9700).\n\nWorking with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.\n\nRelated Documents\n\n"},

Compared with the first quarter of 2020, exports fell by 17.7% and imports by 16.7%, the largest fall since the 2009 financial crisis.\nMonthly data for the second quarter reveal that the collapse in trade occurred in April 2020 when most countries had stringent COVID‑19 containment measures in place. Compared to March 2020, G20 exports and imports fell by 18.7% and 16.0% respectively. However, data for May and June point to a partial recovery from the April lows in nearly all G20 economies, as containment measures eased. July data, in those economies where data are available, point to a continued improvement.\nChina was the only G20 economy to record export growth in the second quarter of 2020 (up 9.1%), following a 9.3% fall in the first quarter. Chinese imports however continued to fall, by 4.9%. Australia registered only single-digit falls in both exports (down by 4.4%) and imports (down by 5.6%). In Japan, exports fell by 15.2% and imports by 4.6%, while in Korea exports dropped by 20.1% and imports by 10.8%.\nIndia and Indonesia experienced particularly sharp falls in exports (down by 30.1% and 15.9% respectively) and imports (down by 47.4% and 18.5% respectively).

Support for workers and the export-dependent economy should continue, given falling employment and the risk of prolonged disruption to trade and global value chains, according to a new OECD report.\nThanks to the government’s prompt response to the pandemic, Korea is experiencing the shallowest recession among OECD countries. However, the recovery will be slow and uncertainty remains high, says the latest OECD Economic Survey of Korea. The Survey recommends continuing economic support measures to households and business until a recovery is fully under way, while ensuring that fiscal plans preserve long-term fiscal sustainability. Income support should be targeted to low-income households, and skills training should be offered even beyond the crisis to help vulnerable people who lost their job find employment in new areas.\nSound public finances mean there is room for fiscal stimulus. The Survey suggests focusing investment in some of the areas featuring in the recent Korean New Deal, such as 5G telecommunication and artificial intelligence. Reforming regulations, cutting barriers to competition and encouraging innovation could help to diffuse new technologies through the economy and lift productivity.\nThe Survey projects a rebound in activity after the sizeable drop in the first half of 2020, with a 0.8% contraction in 2020 and 3.1% growth in 2021, absent a resurgence of the pandemic. While domestic-oriented activity is normalising gradually, the global recession is holding back exports and investment. A second global wave of infections would delay the recovery: GDP would then contract by 2% in 2020, and growth reach only 1.4% in 2021.\nFurther disruptions in world trade and global value chains would hurt the Korean economy, which depends heavily on exports and is deeply integrated in global value chains. In addition, the COVID-19 crisis is creating financial risks, notwithstanding a wide range of policy interventions, as rising unemployment and loss of income affect debt reimbursement by households and small businesses, while uncertainty increases financial market volatility.\nThe Survey examines the looming pressures of an ageing population, with Korea’s old-age dependency ratio set to be the highest of any OECD country by 2060. It notes that the share of elderly people in relative poverty – defined as living on less than half of the median household income of the total population – is the highest among OECD countries. It recommends further increasing the basic old-age pension and focusing it on people in absolute poverty, as well as addressing high unemployment among disadvantaged groups and the wide gender wage gap. Along with stronger social protection, easing labour market regulations would promote productivity and reduce labour market duality.\nA Survey chapter on the digital economy looks at the potential to boost productivity and well-being by building on the country’s outstanding digital infrastructure and IT technology and addressing digital skills gaps and the digital gap between large and small firms. The Survey recommends building on the system of regulatory sandboxes – where regulatory obligations can be partly waived to encourage innovation in products or business models – to improve product market regulations. It also recommends facilitating the use of telemedicine to boost productivity and well-being.\n\nSee an Overview of the Survey with key findings and charts in English and Korean\n\nFor further information, journalists are invited to contact Catherine Bremer in the OECD Media Office (+33 1 45 24 97 00).\n\nWorking with over 100 countries, the OECD is a global policy forum that promotes policies to improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.\n\nRelated Documents\n\n"},
