Hunger levels on the continent are twice the world average.\nIFAD is the only multilateral development organization soley dedicated to eradicating rural poverty and hunger. In the letters, the African leaders called for a significant increase in contributions to IFAD’s Twelfth Replenishment (IFAD12) – a year-long consultative process during which Member States come together to agree on strategic directions and mobilize funds for IFAD to provide as concessional loans and grants to developing countries.\n“This support from the African Heads of State is a testimony to the real impact IFAD is having on the lives and livelihoods of rural people in these countries,” said Marie Haga, IFAD’s Associate Vice President for External Relations and Governance. “Their support demonstrates the importance of investing in rural areas to achieve national food security, environmental sustainability and economic development which has a monumental impact on global stability and resilience.”\nAbout 75 per cent of the world's poorest people live in rural areas and depend on agriculture and related activities for their livelihoods. In the letters, the African leaders highlight the immense potential of African agriculture and the strong evidence that investing in agriculture is one of the most effective ways of reducing poverty.\nIFAD aims to deliver an overall programme of work of US$10 billion for the IFAD12 period (2022–2024), with over half of investments allocated to Africa. This would help more than 140 million small-scale producers increase their production and raise their incomes through better market access and resilience, contributing to creating jobs and improving food security and nutrition for those most at risk of being left behind.\n“A successful replenishment has the potential to unlock billions of dollars in financing to transform rural economies and food systems around the world, as well as enable IFAD to double its impact by 2030 and contribute to ending poverty and hunger,” wrote the leaders.\nAs the pandemic sweeps across the world, the poor and the vulnerable are those who suffer most, among them rural women, young people and small-scale farmers. Faced with the socio-economic repercussions of the pandemic and the impact of prolonged drought and locust infestation, the African leaders called to collectively reaffirm the world’s commitment to end hunger.\nPress release No.: \nIFAD\n/49/2020\nIFAD invests in rural people, empowering them to reduce poverty, increase food security, improve nutrition and strengthen resilience.

Together.\n \n\"The present moment is again fraught with danger, complicated, and demands urgent action. As hunger grows once more, as the COVID-19 pandemic exposes the fragility of our food systems, history is calling upon us once more to rise to the challenge,\" urged Qu.\nThe Director-General spoke today at \nFAO's global 75th Anniversary/World Food Day virtual event in Rome\n, which brought together Pope Francis; Italy's President; Lesotho's King and Spain's Queen - FAO Special Goodwill Ambassadors for Nutrition; UN's Secretary General; and the heads of IFAD and WFP.\nSaluting FAO's anniversary, Pope Francis described the organization's mission as \"beautiful and important\".\nWorld Food Day is marked this year as \nglobal hunger rises\n for the fifth consecutive year and a healthy diet is out of reach for 3 billion people. Nearly 700 million people still go hungry, and the pandemic could tip up to 132 million more into hunger by the end of 2020.\nThis year's World Food Day aims to galvanize and accelerate action towards ending hunger and malnutrition in all its forms, and to make food and agriculture an essential part of the COVID-19 response.\nChief amongst them, as speakers at today's event noted, are global solidarity and building more resilient, robust agri-food systems that can withstand shocks, deliver affordable and sustainable healthy diets for all, and decent livelihoods for all workers along the food supply chain.  \n\"Now is the time to rethink our approaches and redouble our efforts,\" said Qu.\nAmongst these, Qu highlighted pioneering sciences and technologies, stressing that \"Innovation is our ally in re-imagining our food systems and ending hunger, as we are morally and politically bound to do in the next ten years\".\nPope Francis urged for more support for FAO's and all UN food agencies' initiatives that promote sustainable and diversified agriculture, and support small farming communities and the rural development of the poorest countries.\nUsing the money that buys arms and covers military expenses for defeating hunger and rural development instead would also be a \"courageous decision\", said the Pope.\n\"Hunger is not merely a disaster for humanity but also a disgrace... We cannot fail to respond or to act. We all are responsible,\" said Pope Francis.\nHis words were echoed by UN's Secretary-General António Guterres who called for intensified efforts to achieve the vision of Sustainable Development Goals - \"a future where everyone everywhere has access to the nutrition they need\". To inspire action towards this vision, Guterres said, he will convene a Food Systems Summit next year.\nNoting that his country was proud to host FAO's headquarters, Italy's President Sergio Mattarella said he welcomed FAO's and its Director-General's \"commitment to work with Italy and many other countries in forging a \"food coalition\" aimed at containing the effects of COVID-19 on food systems\".\nThis is the moment of \"crucial choices\", and of \"a serious global commitment,\" concluded Mattarella who expressed hope for the international community to rediscover a \"profound meaning of the valuable goods the earth offers us\" and the \"responsibility to share and safeguard them for future generations\".\nFAO Goodwill Ambassadors for Nutrition, King Letsie III of Lesotho and Queen Letizia of Spain stressed that healthy diets were everyone's right.\nKing Letsie III underlined that most of the people who cannot afford a healthy diet live in Africa and Asia, and called for \"concerted efforts to bring down the cost of nutritious foods\" so more people can afford them.\n\"The nutritional status of the most vulnerable populations groups is likely to deteriorate further as a result of the destructive health and social economic impact of COVID-19,\" warned King Letsie III.\nHighlighting that hundreds of millions go hungry whilst many more suffer from obesity, Queen Letizia said: \"These imbalances should make us think about how to strengthen food systems, seeking shorter marketing pathways to encourage local, seasonal, sustainable and small-scale production, a strategy that would also make life easier for many women in regions of the world where their vulnerability is extreme.\"\nThe president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development's (IFAD) Gilbert F. Houngbo said:\n\"We know that when crisis strikes, it is the poor and the vulnerable who suffer the most. We just cannot help but be aware of this reality and focus our attention on these most marginalized people, particularly in rural settings. At a time like this, these rural people need our support even more. But we also need them. If we want strong, healthy and peaceful societies, first we need to produce enough nutritious food for everyone.\"\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) was last week awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize for Peace, which many speakers today lauded as a recognition of hunger as a threat to peace and the need for the international community to turn its attention to addressing food insecurity. \nDavid Beasley, Executive Director of WFP said: \"2021 is looking very bleak. But I believe that if we reached deep into the hearts and pockets of the people around the world, we can perform another miracle.\"\n\"But as long as we have man-made conflicts, we will never end hunger,\" warned Beasley. \"It is critical that we end the wars, it is critical that we respond to climate extremes...If we strengthen the fragile governments out there, do the things we know that we have the expertise to do, I believe that we will be celebrating World Food Day in a way we have never done before because hunger will be at the end.\"\nEarlier today, the FAO Director-General participated in an online World Food Day event in Brussels hosted by the European Parliamentary Alliance against Hunger and Malnutrition, whose continued efforts to put food and nutrition high on the political agenda, he commended. \nQu was joined, amongst others, by the Vice-President of the European Parliament, Heidi Hautala, and the European Commissioner for Agriculture, Janusz Wojciechowski. \nHautala called for globalized and systematic solutions, innovation and equity as part of efforts to build back better and end hunger. Wojciechowski spoke about EU's Green Deal and noted the Commission's COVID-19 response work with FAO on food security and rural development. \nThis renewed sense of commitment and call to action today is all the more important as a \njoint study\n of FAO and partners revealed this week that we could end hunger by 2030 if donors double their investments and spend the money wisely.\n\"The scourge of hunger has been tormenting humankind for millennia. But we are the generation that can end it, once and for all,\" said FAO Director-General.\nThis year's World Food Day also honours all \nfood heroes\n, who - despite all difficulties - continue to provide food to their communities and beyond.\nToday, FAO and its partners are urging everyone to show gratitude for the food we eat and the people who produce, plant, harvest, fish or transport it.\nEvents in over 150 countries, including at Rome's Colosseum that is serving as a stunning backdrop for an FAO \nvideo mapping show\n this evening, mark World Food Day and celebrate the world's food heroes and FAO's anniversary.\n \n", "abstract": "16 October 2020, Rome - Today, \nWorld Food Day\n marks the 75th anniversary of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.\nBorn ..."},

Women, who typically have limited access to land and finance, will make up 50 per cent of the project’s participants. About 35 per cent will be young people who face high rates of unemployment.\nThe $62 million project, which will provide the means for a six-year extension of the successful Smallholder Agriculture Development Project (SADP I), was announced today by the International Fund for Agricultural Development of the United Nations (IFAD). Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD, and Thabo Sophonea, Minister of Finance of the Kingdom of Lesotho, signed the financing agreement for the Smallholder Agriculture Development Project (SADP II) by correspondence.\nThe total project financing amounts to $62 million, with $50 million from the World Bank and a $5 million loan from IFAD. The beneficiaries themselves are providing $5 million, and JICA will contribute an additional $2 million. The project will reach all 10 districts of the kingdom, an increase from the 7 districts reached through SADP I.\nSADP II will build on the achievements of the project’s first phase. It aims to empower women and youth who are especially vulnerable to climate-related events and other shocks. According to the International Labour Organization, 38.5 per cent of young people in Lesotho, aged 15-24, are unemployed. The creation of sustainable rural employment opportunities will lead to increased incomes and greater long-term resilience.\n“In the face of COVID-19, it is even more important that we not allow that progress achieved against poverty during SADP I be lost, or that hunger be allowed to increase,” said Philipp Baumgartner, Country Director for Lesotho. “Small-scale farmers need greater support so that food production, processing and marketing continue, contributing to the country’s food security and economy. I am particularly happy to see an increased focus on youth entrepreneurship and nutrition aspects in this second phase of SADP. ”\nSADP II will promote the cultivation of cash crops, such as fruits and vegetables, and will link farmers to markets where they can sell their products. Project participants will also benefit from new technologies for land and water management including the modernization of irrigation infrastructure to reduce producers’ dependence on rain-fed farming. Furthermore, the project will train participants’ on nutrition, food preparation and better hygiene.\nSince 1995, IFAD has invested $92.1 million in 11 rural development programmes and projects in the Kingdom of Lesotho worth a total of almost $232.6 million.

The Facility is supporting small-scale farmers and rural producers to continue to grow and sell food despite COVID-19 restrictions in movement and trade, by providing timely access to agricultural inputs, information, markets and liquidity.\n“We would like to thank Sweden for its commitment to achieving a world without poverty and hunger,” said Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD.  “The funds will assist rural producers, particularly women, to continue making food available on the markets, ensuring that the COVID-19 pandemic does not escalate into a lingering food crisis.”\n“In the midst of the pandemic, we need to support sustainable food production to reduce poverty and achieve Zero Hunger by 2030. Small-scale farmers are in the frontline and they need assistance now,” said Carin Jämtin, Sida's Director-General.\nSweden also committed SEK 40 million (approximately US$4.6 million) to IFAD’s \nFinancing Facility for Remittances\n. This will help maximize the impact of remittances and diaspora investment on rural development, accelerate the transformation of remittance markets through new technologies, and promote financial inclusion so that families receiving remittances use their funds productively.\nRemittance flows, often a lifeline for rural families in the developing world, are projected to decline by about 20 per cent this year due to migrant workers’ loss of employment worldwide, and reduced access to transfer operators caused by the COVID-19 restrictions. \nAbout 80 per cent of the world’s poorest and most food-insecure people live in rural areas. Around 135 million people were recently categorised as facing acute food insecurity and malnutrition. It is estimated that this number could nearly double before the end of the year due to the impacts of COVID-19.\nMovement restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus left many small-scale producers without access markets to sell produce or to buy seeds or fertilizer.

Gilbert F. Houngbo, IFAD President, and Alamine Ousmane Mey, Minister of Economy, Planning and Regional Development of the Republic of Cameroon met virtually to sign the financing agreement for the second phase of the Commodity Value Chain Development Support Project (PADFA II).\nCameroon has great potential to meet its food demand and improve the living conditions of the rural population. About 32,000 poor rural households will benefit from the new project, which will help small-scale farmers and boost rice and onion production in the country. The project’s overarching goal is to strengthen rural livelihoods for greater income, improve food security and nutrition, and integrate approaches to mitigate the impact of climate change.\nSmall-scale farmers in rice and onion value chains have faced relatively low productivity and income. The project will introduce measures to ensure the availability of quality climate-resilient seeds and other inputs, and more efficient land and water management, including the modernization of irrigation infrastructure to reduce producers’ dependence on rain-fed farming. It will also work to minimize post-harvest losses by providing adequate storage and processing facilities.\nThe project aims to empower women and youth who are especially vulnerable to climate-related events and other shocks. Fifty per cent of the project’s participants will be women, who typically have limited access to finance and production tools. At least 30 per cent of the participants will be young people, who often face high rates of unemployment.\nIFAD has financed the project with a loan of US$47.0 million. US$10.8 million is provided through domestic cofinancing, including US$8.7 million from the Government of Cameroon and US$2.1 million from the beneficiaries themselves. Additional cofinancing of approximately US$2.1 million from other development partners is currently being finalized. The project will reach 15 departments in the country – North, Far North, Northwest and West - an increase from the eleven districts reached through PADFA.\n“This new financing agreement comes at the right time, as we face the cascading negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Abdelhaq Hanafi, Country Director for Cameroon. “Small-scale producers are at the centre of IFAD’s work and investing in them is a prerequisite for ensuring food security.”\nPADFA II will work with 111 farmers’ cooperatives to boost the production and productivity of small-scale farmers, develop a rice and onion improved seeds programme, and facilitate access to rural finance and markets where farmers can sell their products.\nIt will address food loss by building 26 rice warehouses, 28 bioclimatic houses for onion storage and five collection and packaging centres for onions and by rehabilitating 25 km of rural roads for access of products to markets. Installation of two rice-parboiling units will add value to rice processing.\nParticipants in this project will benefit from training on nutrition, food preparation and better hygiene. And young people can look forward to the creation of decent jobs to support the transportation of products and maintenance of infrastructure.  \nSince 1981, IFAD has invested $201.6 million in 11 rural development programmes and projects in Cameroon worth a total of almost $421.3 million.

This sets the stage for increased investments in food security, employment, and rural economic growth, and is an important step towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nIFAD is the first fund in the United Nations system to receive a public credit rating. The AA+ (stable) rating was announced by Fitch Ratings, which also assigned IFAD a short-term rating of F1+.\n“The strong rating comes at a critical time when the impacts of COVID-19 threaten to push millions more rural people into hunger and poverty. This rating will allow IFAD to strengthen and diversify its resource base, and build global resilience to future shocks,” said Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD.\nAs the only global development organization exclusively dedicated to transforming agriculture, rural economies and food systems by making them more inclusive, productive, resilient and sustainable, IFAD plays a central role in the fight against extreme poverty and food insecurity.\nThis credit rating adds momentum to international efforts to catalyze additional financing to achieve the SDGs by 2030 and ensure no one is left behind.\nIFAD-supported projects and programmes are funded through contributions from its 177 Member States, investment income and reflows, as well as cofinancing from other sources.\nWith Official Development Assistance (ODA) under pressure in recent years, IFAD has been exploring new funding models to help it double its impact on reducing poverty and hunger by 2030, and meet the changing needs of borrowing countries.\n“Meeting the needs of all our Member States requires IFAD to develop a diversified, broader and more predictable funding base so that we can expand our financial offer for the benefit of our borrowing countries,” said Houngbo.\n“The credit rating will provide us with greater scope to forge partnerships including with the private sector, the public development banks that we will be working with at the Finance In Common Summit in November, and gives us the means to leverage every dollar of taxpayer money we receive, allowing IFAD to maximize its support to the poorest of the poor.”\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, there could be up to 132 million more hungry people in 2020 alone, and extreme poverty looks set to increase for the first time in decades.

At the same time, addressing the challenges posed by the pandemic provides an opportunity for countries to improve their agricultural production processes, enhance their value chain development, and transform their food systems.\nValerie Guarnieri, WFP Assistant Executive Director, Programme and Policy Development Department, highlighted that this pandemic calls for out-of-the-box thinking, along with the need for greater engagement among partners and the use of innovative service delivery methods to reach the most vulnerable populations. She provided concrete examples of how WFP is supporting host governments with innovative SSTC solutions. She also noted, “\nHere today, with the Rome-based agencies, and in the face of [ … ] growing needs due to COVID-19, we have an opportunity to mobilize more technical expertise from Global South countries that are managing the impact of the pandemic and are ready to share those experiences with others; innovation, such as digital modalities, can support more efficient brokering of SSTC\n.”\nThe country representatives at the event welcomed the proposed increase of SSTC activities on the ground, with a particular focus on value chain development, youth engagement in the area of technology, and collaboration with the private sector.\nThe importance of learning from and sharing experiences within African countries was emphasized by H.E. Henri Djombo, Minister of State, Minister of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, and Governor of IFAD for the Republic of the Congo. As he put it, “\nWe have to turn towards other African countries and their experiences and successes and ensure the foundations for the development of agriculture through financing.\n” He also noted the importance of SSTC initiatives in the context of cassava, particularly the good work being done by the Rome-based agencies to improve cassava production through innovative technologies.\nThe huge potential for youth to be a driving force in agricultural transformation and rural development was the central topic of discussion for H.E. José Ángel López Camposeco, Minister of Agriculture, Livestock and Food of the Republic of Guatemala. In particular, he stressed the need “\nto generate opportunities for young people, support them and break down the barriers so that they are involved in production processes in rural areas.” \nHe added:\n “Youth has huge potential and we should tap into that. We can bring technology into agriculture through young people.\n”\nH.E. Niu Dun, Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture in Rome of the People’s Republic of China, reiterated his country’s support for SSTC and stressed the importance of collaboration among partners to fight the pandemic. Ambassador Niu Dun also underlined the plan of the People’s Republic of China to invest more in rural agriculture, to enhance its agricultural production, and to review its agriculture policies to ensure the best possible support for its farmers.\nOne key area highlighted by multiple participants was the need to increase the number of exchange of innovative solutions generated by developing countries for the benefit of other developing countries. There is great potential here for the Rome-based agencies and their development partners to step up their efforts to increase knowledge- and expertise-sharing, which remain invaluable tools for supporting small-scale farmers.\n“\nSSTC is central in the activities that we carry out in the ACP countries. The COVID-19 threats cannot be successfully addressed independently by one country, region or continent,\n” said Escipión Joaquín Oliveira Gómez, Assistant Secretary General for Structural Economic Transformation and Trade of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. Touching on the central role of private sector actors in SSTC, he added: “\nWe believe that private sector collaboration is essential to this work. Agricultural production in our countries plays a critical role to improve livelihoods.\n”\nThree years after the release of the \nJoint Roadmap towards BAPA+40: Strengthening collaboration among Rome-based Agencies on South-South and Triangular Cooperation\n, the representatives of FAO, IFAD and WFP renewed their commitment to working together to achieve the Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals by promoting and leveraging SSTC activities on the ground.\nContacts\nFor more information, visit the \nevent page\n.\n", "abstract": "On 16 September, the United Nations Rome-based agencies − the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), IFAD and the World Food P..."},

Para la región, la necesidad de garantizar a su población en rápido crecimiento un acceso seguro a productos alimentarios básicos, pero también de calidad, supone una presión cada vez mayor”, sostuvo la Sra. Dina Saleh, Directora Regional de la División del Cercano Oriente, África del Norte y Europa del FIDA.\n“El acto de hoy consiste en un diálogo con 16 países asociados sobre la manera de aunar nuestros esfuerzos para superar desafíos tales como las situaciones de fragilidad, la migración, la seguridad alimentaria y la escasez de agua, que están obstaculizando el desarrollo rural sostenible en la región”.\nA la sesión, titulada “Intensificar la actuación del FIDA en favor de una transformación rural inclusiva y sostenible en la región árabe”, asistirán representantes de Arabia Saudita, Argelia, Egipto, los Emiratos Árabes Unidos, Iraq, Jordania, Kuwait, el Líbano, Libia, Marruecos, Omán, Qatar, Siria, Sudán, Túnez y el Yemen.\nEl encuentro se celebra en el contexto de la Duodécima Reposición de los Recursos del FIDA, período para el que la organización pide a los Estados Miembros que aumenten su financiación para que el Fondo pueda duplicar su impacto de cara a la reducción de la pobreza y el hambre para 2030. El diálogo virtual contribuirá a orientar y respaldar las actividades futuras del FIDA en la región árabe y sus actuales esfuerzos por movilizar recursos, así como intensificar su colaboración de larga data con los países árabes.\n“Es sumamente apremiante transformar los sistemas agroalimentarios de la región; el FIDA está adaptando su modelo operacional para adecuar su respuesta a la evolución de las necesidades de la población rural a la que presta apoyo”, afirmó el Sr. Ronald Hartman, Director de la División de Participación Activa, Asociaciones y Movilización de Recursos a Nivel Mundial del FIDA.\n“El FIDA está ampliando su gama tradicional de instrumentos financieros con objeto de incorporar herramientas más adecuadas para colaborar con el sector privado, y hacer frente a la vulnerabilidad climática y aumentar la resiliencia”.\nLa región árabe se ha visto afectada por conflictos armados prolongados, perturbaciones climáticas y una pandemia sin precedentes, que han agravado la seguridad alimentaria y la nutrición y han aumentado la pobreza y las tasas de desempleo.\nEn esta región se registran los mayores niveles de escasez de agua del mundo, y la agricultura en pequeña escala se ve cada vez más amenazada por las malas cosechas, lo que empuja a millones de hogares rurales a emigrar a las zonas urbanas, donde a menudo tienen dificultades para encontrar un empleo. Las tasas de desempleo juvenil se sitúan entre las más elevadas del mundo, y se prevé que la COVID-19 provoque la pérdida de 1,7 millones de puestos de trabajo.\nEl FIDA lleva desde 1981 adoptando soluciones a medida para abordar los principales desafíos que entorpecen el desarrollo rural sostenible. Ha invertido un total de 6 460 millones de dólares de los Estados Unidos (de los cuales, 2 180 millones provienen de sus propios recursos) en 132 proyectos y programas ejecutados en 13 países de la región árabe.\nA día de hoy, las operaciones del FIDA en la región benefician a más de 2 millones de personas del medio rural, cuya inversión total asciende a 1 560 millones de dólares de los Estados Unidos.\n \n \nEl FIDA invierte en la población rural y, al empoderar a estas personas, las ayuda a reducir la pobreza, aumentar la seguridad alimentaria, mejorar la nutrición y fortalecer la resiliencia. Desde 1978, hemos destinado 22 400 millones de dólares de los Estados Unidos en donaciones y préstamos a bajo interés a proyectos que han permitido llegar a alrededor de 512 millones de personas.

They are the ones who work in the informal sector and are at most risk of being unemployed. They are the ones without social safety nets. But they are also the ones growing the food for urban and rural communities,” said van Ginneneken, who has dedicated her professional career to fighting poverty, most recently as Chief Executive Officer of the SNV Netherlands Development Organisation. “This is where we need to urgently invest.”\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, there could be up to 132 million more hungry people in 2020 alone, and extreme poverty looks set to increase for the first time in two decades. The impact is greatest in rural areas, where the majority of the world's poorest and hungriest people live – most of whom depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Rural small-scale farmers produce 50 percent of the world’s food calories.\n“When building back from the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has an opportunity to get it right,” said van Ginneneken. “Getting it right has multiple dimensions. One is to create a world that is more sustainable and resilient to climate change. Another is to be more equitable. This time we canot leave anyone behind.”\nIn her previous role at SNV, van Ginneneken oversaw the growth of the organization which focuses on the development of agriculture, energy and water in 28 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Prior to this, she held various leadership positions at the World Bank.  In her new role, she will lead the team that provides expert guidance on IFAD's strategic direction, thematic priorities and technical quality of the organization’s operations.\n“As the leader of the Strategy and Knowledge Department, I will be in a unique position to ensure that IFAD’s technical knowledge to build more resilient and sustainable food systems will be deployed in every country where IFAD works,” she said.\nIFAD is the only global development organization that works exclusively on eradicating poverty and hunger in rural areas.

Implemented by the Development Bank of Ethiopia, it will help farmers to access financial services, raise and diversify their incomes, improve nutrition and build their resilience in rural areas threatened by climate change.\nThe virtual launch involved project participants, government officials, UN and IFAD staff, including Solomon Desta, Vice Governor of the National Bank of Ethiopia, Yohannes Ayalew, President of the Development Bank of Ethiopia, Catherine Sozi, United Nations Resident Coordinator to Ethiopia and said Ulaç Demirag, IFAD Country Director for Ethiopia.\nThe funding includes a $35.1 million grant and $4.9 million loan from IFAD, with significant cofinancing from international development partners and from national financial institutions. The Government of Ethiopia’s contribution is $51.9 million and $0.9million from the beneficiaries themselves.\nEthiopia’s agriculture sector, which employs 80 per cent of the population, continues to suffer from frequent droughts aggravated by climate change. In 2017, insufficient rainfall during the rainy season led to catastrophic crop and livestock losses and left an estimated 8.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.\n”RUFIP I and II made major contributions, not just in including 5 million customers in microfinance institutions, but also in improving regulatory capacities in microfinance, banking and lease finance supervision,” said Solomon Desta, Vice Governor of the National Bank of Ethiopia. ” RUFIP showed that microfinance is a better strategy for financial inclusion of the vulnerable poor  - by comparison there are 5 million microfinance institution borrowers as against only 0.3 million in banks.”\nRUFIP III will build on the lessons and experiences of the first two phases of the programme, and will scale up delivery of rural financial services tailored to the needs of the most vulnerable smallholder farmers, particularly women and young people.\n“IFAD is a key United Nations agency in Ethiopia, having made more than US$750 million of investments so far and reaching 7 million vulnerable households. RUFIP III is also part of the UN response to COVID-19, helping to support smallholder farmers in accessing rural financial services,” said Catherine Sozi, United Nations Resident Coordinator to Ethiopia. “I look forward to the implementation of RUFIP III and its results and impacts.”\nThrough the project, rural finance institutions will be able to deliver an expanded range of financial products and services to a large number of rural poor people. It will also support the uptake of these products by rural savings and credit cooperatives and microfinance institutions through financial literacy training. It will also develop insurance products through the rural finance institutions to allow smallholder farmers to mitigate the risks related to climate change.\n“RUFIP III is really about people -- it is not to simply make credit available to the rural population, to strengthen the microfinance sector in Ethiopia and to promote agro-industrialization, but to bring 13.5 million vulnerable rural households on a sustainable path to prosperity,” said Ulaç Demirag, IFAD Country Director for Ethiopia.\nDespite improvements, Ethiopia’s child malnutrition rates are still the highest in sub-Saharan Africa. The programme will also promote nutrition awareness through campaigns and demonstrations, targeting the areas most vulnerable to food insecurity due to climate change. It will also help farmers and small enterprises to enhance their resilience to weather related shocks.\nSince 1980, IFAD has invested $795.5 million in 20 rural development programmes and projects in Ethiopia worth a total of $2.1 billion. These have directly benefited around 12 million rural households.\nPress release No.\n: IFAD/46/2020\nIFAD invests in rural people, empowering them to reduce poverty, increase food security, improve nutrition and strengthen resilience.

Houngbo, President of the UN’s International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in a strong call to governments to increase their investments in rural women.\n“It is unacceptable that rural women, who play such a vital role in growing our food and building thriving economies, are at greatest risk during the pandemic,” said Houngbo on the occasion of the International Day of Rural Women. “Our global resilience depends on governments paying greater attention to the disproportionate socio-economic impacts on rural women and stepping up their investments to protect them.”\nThere are approximately 1.7 billion women and girls living in rural areas, representing more than one-fifth of all humanity. Rural women make up 43 per cent of the agricultural work force in developing countries, and are responsible for much of the world’s food production. However they have less access than men to technologies, markets, financial assets and agricultural resources, making them far more vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-19.\nRestrictions on movement have limited the ability of rural producers to grow and sell their produce. Rural women, who are often employed informally with no social protection, have faced higher job loss than men, whilst also experiencing an increase in unpaid domestic workloads including caring for sick family members and children not in school.\n“Rural women – the people who have the greatest responsibility for feeding and raising the next generation – have been neglected through this crisis,” said Houngbo. “It is time to elevate the important contribution they make to their families, communities and the economies of their nations, and ensure that they are supported and protected through this unprecedented time.”\nWhile much progress has been made in the 25 years since the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action which provided a framework for addressing women’s empowerment, achieving gender equality in rural areas has been challenging. Women aged 25-34 are still 25 percent more likely than men to live in extreme poverty.\nNotes to Editor\nPress release No.: IFAD/48/2020\nIFAD invests in rural people, empowering them to reduce poverty, increase food security, improve nutrition and strengthen resilience.
