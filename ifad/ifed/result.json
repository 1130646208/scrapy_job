The continuous use of unsustainable agricultural practices, and the devastation of forests and wildlife, are part of what has brought us into closer contact with the virus that causes COVID-19,” said IFAD President, Gilbert F. Houngbo. “Indigenous Peoples have long warned of the consequences of exactly these kinds of practices”.\nHoungbo was speaking ahead of today’s event focused on the importance of partnering with Indigenous Peoples to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and build a more resilient future, to be held on the margins of the United Nations High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The event is co-convened by Canada, Finland, the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and Indigenous Peoples Major Group (IPMG) for Sustainable Development.\n“We must recognize and acknowledge the important role that Indigenous Peoples play in supporting and protecting sustainable livelihoods. They provide sound stewardship of our environment, and help build greater biodiversity and sustainable food systems,” said Minister Karina Gould, Canada’s Minister of International Development who is opening the event.\nThe event will examine how Indigenous Peoples’ knowledge, values and sustainable systems can help achieve zero hunger and end poverty in all forms by 2030. It will also discuss why it is critical to prioritize protection of their rights, and increase their access to land, productive resources and health services to help them cope with the adverse impacts of the pandemic - whilst also securing their participation in relevant development processes.\n“As we work together to craft a global response to COVID-19, we need to recognise Indigenous Peoples’ actual and potential contributions to sustainable development,” said Houngbo. “Too often they are systematically marginalized, suffer violations of their human rights and are excluded from – and actually harmed by – development processes. This is not acceptable and our approach to dealing with Indigenous Peoples must change.”\nThere are approximately 476 million Indigenous Peoples in over 90 countries. Despite representing over six per cent of the global population, they account for about 18 per cent of the world’s poor. They are at disproportionate risk in public health emergencies, becoming even more vulnerable during this global pandemic.\nIndigenous Peoples are custodians of about 80 per cent of the world’s biodiversity and are also among the worst affected by climate change as a result of their close interaction and reliance upon the climate and natural systems.\nIFAD has been working with Indigenous Peoples since the beginning of its operations, considering them a priority group in the fight of rural poverty. IFAD reaches more than 6 million Indigenous Peoples in 31 countries through 63 projects with US$660 million of funding. IFAD convenes the Indigenous Peoples Forum in Rome every two years.\n\nNote to editor:\nThe event “Partnering with Indigenous Peoples: Leveraging their knowledge to achieve the SDGs by 2030 while recognizing the challenge to address the outbreak of COVID-19” will belivestreamedon 14 July 8.00 – 9.00am (EDT).\n\n\nIFAD invests in rural people, empowering them to reduce poverty, increase food security, improve nutrition and strengthen resilience.

This is because most rural people depend on agricultural supply chains for their incomes and food, and these supply chains are being disrupted,” said Ziller. “It is not enough to respond with humanitarian assistance alone. We have to build crisis-resilient supply chains, otherwise people will keep going to bed hungry.”\nAccording to the report on theState of Food Security and Nutrition in the Worldreleased last month, hunger has increased in the past five years, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to leave an additional 83 to 132 million people hungry by the end of the year.\nIFAD is an international financial institution and specialized agency of the United Nations dedicated to eradicating rural poverty and hunger in developing countries. Ziller, a German national and the former Director General for International Development Cooperation at the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), starts his new role at IFAD at a pivotal time.\n“Five years ago we, the global community, made a promise when we adopted the Sustainable Development Goals. We are completely off track in achieving Zero Hunger, and we only have 10 years left to fulfil our promise,” said Ziller.  “But we can’t put our hands in our laps and give up. We have to go the extra mile. And that is why I am very pleased to join IFAD – an organisation that I believe can really help build a world without hunger.”\nThe majority of the world's poorest and hungriest people live in rural areas and depend on agriculture and related activities for their livelihoods. As the second in command of the Fund, Ziller will provide counsel and support on IFAD’s strategic direction and all aspects of its operations and activities, and will help strengthen the political and financial support for IFAD among Member States.\nIn his previous role at BMZ, Ziller’s responsibilities included the European Union's development cooperation, and the development pro­cesses of the G7 and the G20.

Seventy-five per cent of the country’s lower income people live in rural areas and, though rural poverty has decreased in recent years, several challenges remain pertinent. More than 375,000 rural people in eastern Uzbekistan’s Fergana valley will benefit from new financing that aims to increase their incomes through the introduction of modern farming techniques, provide access to long-term financing for agriculture, and create jobs in rural areas.\nInclusive and profitable value chains, accessible markets and modern, climate-resilient rural infrastructure will enabledehkan farmers(small household plots) to diversify agricultural production from low to high value crops, increase land productivity and address challenges of drought due to climate change.\nThe US$47 million investment provides additional financing to the ongoingAgriculture Diversification and Modernization Project (ADMP). Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development of the United Nations (IFAD), and Sardor Uktamovich Umurzakov, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Investment and Foreign Trade met virtually to sign the financing agreement on 4 August.\nADMP has a total project value of $356.9 million, of which $93.5 million is from IFAD. In addition to the new top-up loan of $46.2 million, IFAD has financed the project with a loan of US$ 46.2 million (original loan), a grant (original) of $0.3 million, and a grant (additional top up grant) of $0.8 million. The World Bank cofinanced the project with a loan of $200 million. Moreover, US$63.4 million is provided through domestic cofinancing, including $24.5 million from the government, $19.4 million from beneficiary contributions and $19.5 million financing from participant financing institutions.\nThe Uzbek economy has been one of the best performers in the world in recent years, with economic growth averaging 8 per cent for the past ten years. However, since March 2020, the economic outlook has worsened as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. “The crisis has created challenges that significantly impact the poverty levels in rural areas. IFAD is working in close partnership with the Uzbek government to help offset the economic and social implications of the pandemic,” said Vrej Jijyan, IFAD Country Director for Uzbekistan.\nThe overarching goal of the ADMP project, currently in the second year of its implementation, is to create a business environment that enables increased productivity and market access for small-scale agribusinesses and rural enterprises in value chain systems. It will link the agribusinesses to rural households ofdehkanfarms and small-scale producers engaged in horticulture and livestock. The project will pay special attention to ensuring the participation of female-headed households, as well as to reach out to young women.\nUzbekistan joined IFAD in 2011.

Using mobile phone technology, farmers will receive low-cost, customized advice to improve on-farm practices, input utilization, pest and disease management, environmental sustainability and access to markets.\nIFAD’s RPSF, which was launched recently by IFAD’s UN Goodwill Ambassadors, the actor and humanitarian Idris Elba and the model and activist Sabrina Dhowre Elba, aims to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the livelihoods and food security of rural poor people. Funding for these first 11 initiatives, amounting to US$11.2 million from the RPSF plus $5.2 million in co-financing mainly from governments and implementing partners, will benefit an estimated 6.7 million small-scale farmers in developing countries who are adversely impacted by the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAmong the proposals financed are two regionally focused initiatives in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa that will provide emergency livelihood support through local farmers’ organisations, and eight country-level initiatives in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Nepal, Nigeria, Palestine and Rwanda. The majority of these initiatives, which are embedded in national COVID-19 response strategies, will be implemented through IFAD project teams and other strategic partners to ensure fast delivery.\nThe activities that will be delivered include: providing seeds and fertiliser in time for the upcoming planting season; assisting with storage and market transport; supporting local banks to provide credit; and establishing digital platforms for information, training, banking and marketing services. Working through existing project teams and IFAD country offices, the initiatives will draw on existing targeting data to identify and provide assistance to the most at-risk groups.\nA second round of funding, which includes 22 initiatives and amounts to $13.8 million, is expected by the end of August.

Food production is at risk due to disrupted access to inputs, labour, services and markets. Meanwhile food trade and distribution networks may become seriously compromised as a result of volatile global commodity markets, trade and border policies, movement restrictions and market closures.\nThe2020 Report on the State of Food Security and Nutrition(SOFI) estimates that the COVID-19 pandemic may add between 83 and 132 million people to the total number of undernourished in the world.\nIFAD has been among the first to respond to this challenge. In April 2020, it launched the multi-donor Rural Poor Stimulus Facility, a rapid-response fund to improve the resilience of rural livelihoods to the crisis, with an initial allocation of $40 million, and the goal to raise an additional $200 million. IFAD has also repurposed $100 million of ongoing investments in over 100 projects in 65 countries.\nGiven the magnitude of the challenge presented by this pandemic, the China-IFAD SSTC Facility will also contribute to IFAD’s global response to COVID-19 by designating remaining funds to support national governments to build back better, more resilient societies. The Facility’s third call for proposals will therefore support the generation and exchange of innovative solutions, approaches and methodologies that can be of value in the post-COVID-19 recovery period.\nTo build long-term resilience, the Facility will select projects that can be subsequently scaled up, and benefit a wider population of poor rural people, especially those from the most affected countries.\nThe following thematic areas will be considered for funding:\nThe call will be launched on28 August 2020and will place a high priority on national ownership and leadership, development of local capacity and inclusive participation.

Small-scale producers nevertheless produce much of the planet’s food. They therefore need to be at the forefront of any transformation of our food systems.\nSFITAL aims to explore how agricultural systems can be managed sustainably in entire landscapes in a way that respects the environment and enables the producers to thrive.\n“This agreement heralds a significant step in the transition to more sustainable food systems,” said Tony Simons, director-general of ICRAF. “We anticipate that millions of small-scale producers, consumers and the global climate system will benefit enormously from research in development of the tropical agricultural landscapes.”\nSFITAL will focus on palm oil in Indonesia and cocoa in Indonesia and the Philippines. These raw materials are major sources of livelihoods of those living in rural communities who rely on them for employment and business opportunities, yet they are cultivated in areas facing environmental threats, ranging from water stress to deforestation.\nThe collaboration, which commenced on 1 July 2020, is supported financially and on the ground by IFAD, Mars and ICRAF through an investment of approximately US$ 4 million.\n“IFAD is committed to supporting small-scale producers to improve the sustainability and profitability of their farms through better practices, and this grant does that,” said Fabrizio Bresciani, IFAD’s regional economist, Asia and the Pacific. “Together with ICRAF and Mars, we will promote better farm management, lower transactional costs and higher production standards. We will establish innovative traceability systems so small-scale producers can participate in highly profitable and sustainable cocoa and palm-oil value chains.”\nThe challenges facing small-scale producers in tropical regions are numerous. Climate change and poverty, slow or unresponsive governance systems with little interconnectivity, environmentally unfriendly infrastructure, social conflict and limited access to financing mechanisms contribute to unattractive risk environments for investors.\n“Mars has a responsibility to the millions of small-scale producers in our value chains,” said Barry Parkin, Chief Procurement and Sustainability Officer. “And for many of these producers, meeting sustainability standards that are required for access to global markets is incredibly costly. We believe this landscape approach will demonstrate environmentally and socially viable models for more effectively integrating small-scale producers into global supply chains. We need thriving farmers in our collective supply chains to build a safer, more resilient food system for the long term.”\nIn this context, the United Nations’Sustainable Development Goal 17(Partnerships for the Goals) is of paramount importance. SFITAL brings together public, private and research communities to tackle the complex challenges faced by small-scale producers. Through this partnership, SFITAL aims to advance other critical Goals, including Goal 2 on Zero Hunger, Goal 12 on Responsible Consumption and Production, and Goal 15 on Life on Land.\nA collaborative effort by governments, industry, non-governmental organizations and others is needed to co-design and implement with small-scale producers new ways of operating. To address these complex challenges, SFITAL will draw on experience in the two countries with the two raw materials to\nThe progress of the project will be watched closely by governments, development agencies, farmers’ associations and the private sector. The SFITAL team encourages more multi-sectoral collaboration to help expand the scale of sustainable farming, ensuring the swift transformation of the world’s food systems.\n\nMEDIA INQUIRIES\nICRAF: Jeanne Finestone, Head of Communications:j.finestone@cgiar.org; +254 711 946327.\nIFAD: Susan Beccio, Regional Communication Officer, Asia and Pacific:s.beccio@ifad.org.\nMars: Kimberly West,Kimberly.west@effem.com, +1 973 691 3536\n\nAbout IFAD\nIFAD invests in rural people, empowering them to reduce poverty, increase food security, improve nutrition and strengthen resilience.

This sector employs 44 per cent of the population and contributes 5.5 per cent to the country’s GDP. Improving small-scale agricultural production, productivity and commercialization is vital to reducing poverty and improving food security in the rural areas.\nThe government of Angola has implemented several development projects to revitalize the economy. However, more needs to be done to boost the agriculture sector and provide sustainable livelihoods to vulnerable poor people in rural areas. The country also has a large food import bill: US$583 million the first quarter of 2019. Coupled with the decline in oil revenues in 2015-2016 and rising food costs, these factors have impelled the government to start promoting economic diversification. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, such steps are more important than ever.\n“If we want to ensure sustainable food and nutrition security and reduce Angola’s food import bill, the government must invest massively in the agriculture sector,” said Robson Mutandi, Country Director for Angola. “Particular attention to commercializing family farming on a sustainable basis is critical for the prosperity of Angola.”\nThe financing agreement for the Smallholder Resilience Enhancement Project (SREP) was signed today in Rome by Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD, and Maria de Fátima Monteiro Jardim, Ambassador of the Republic of Angola to Italy and Permanent Representative. This $150 million project will particularly target young people and women who are vulnerable to climate shocks, aiming to help them to recover and to build their resilience.\nThe project will promote sustainable practices such as the introduction of drought-tolerant crop varieties, adaptation of cropping calendars and rainwater harvesting. It will invest in small-scale irrigation, increased access to water and climate-resilient farming practices.\nSREP will be implemented in seven provinces in arid, semi-arid and sub-humid agroecological zones - Bengo, Zaire, Uige and Cuanza Norte in the north and Benguela, Cunene and Namibe in the south. It will also strengthen the national private sector’s capacity to improve delivery of advisory and climate information services tailored to family farmers’ needs.\nFunding includes a $29.8 million loan from IFAD, as well as cofinancing from theAgence Française de Développement($42 million) and the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa ($40 million). The Government of Angola is providing $10 million, with a further $6.5 million contributed by beneficiaries themselves. The financing gap of $21.7 million will come from IFAD resources or from other development partners identified during the implementation.\nSREP will also build the capacity of small family farmers in production and processing through farmer field schools so they can become more productive. The project will increase their access to markets by linking them to different private sector actors in value chains.\nFurthermore, appropriate rural infrastructure will be put in place to support market-oriented production, and to enable efficient delivery of surplus production from family farms to markets, allowing small-scale farmers to sell more and improve their livelihoods.\nLivelihood development, improved nutrition and resilience are all critical areas for Angola’s food security, and contribute to several Sustainable Development Goals, including no poverty, zero hunger, gender equality, climate action and life on land (SDGs 1, 2, 5, 13 and 15).\nSince 1990, IFAD has invested $111.8 million in eight rural development programmes and projects in Angola worth a total of almost $284.6 million.

In fact, 85 per cent of the active population are employed in this kind of agriculture, which accounts for 43.4 per cent of GDP. Improving small-scale agricultural production and productivity so that farmers can move from subsistence to commercialization is vital to reducing poverty and improving food and nutrition security in rural areas.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken against it have added new dimensions to the situation. With the existing vulnerabilities in the country, the crisis poses a genuine threat to livelihoods, in particular of small-scale farmers, and the adverse effects are expected to linger on unless there is concrete investment in the agriculture sector.\n”PRECIS comes at the right time,” said Jakob Tuborgh, Country Director for Niger. “The COVID-19 pandemic is posing a threat to the Government’s ambitious poverty reduction targets; this new project will address the major issues of food and nutrition insecurity in Niger, and will create jobs for young rural people while also contributing to several Sustainable Development Goals.”\nThe financing agreement for the Project to Strengthen Resilience of Rural Communities to Food and Nutrition Insecurity (PRECIS) was signed by correspondence by Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD, and Aïchatou Boulama Kané, Minister of Planning and Mamadou Diop, Minister of Finance of the Republic of Niger.\nThis €172.1 million project will particularly target young people and women who are especially vulnerable to climate and other shocks. It aims to help them to access promising rural employment, increase their incomes and build their resilience. The project will have crosscutting impact on the Sustainable Development Goals, starting with SDGs 1 and 2 (no poverty, no hunger), but also gender equality and women’s empowerment and clean water and sanitation (SDGs 5 and 6).\nPRECIS will promote food crops like maize, millet, rice and sorghum and develop market gardening, poultry and small livestock husbandry. To mitigate the effects of desertification and climate change, the project will also promote technologies for sustainable water and land resource management. It will rehabilitate and construct market infrastructure to increase access so that producers can sell their products.\nThe financing includes a €56.7 million loan and €21 million grant from IFAD. The Government of Niger is providing €26.3 million, with a further €4.9 million contributed by beneficiaries themselves. Arrangements for additional co-financing of approximately €63 million from other development partners are currently being finalised. The project will be implemented in Dosso, Maradi, Tahoua and Zinder regions and will reach 186 municipalities.\nPRECIS will build the capacity of small-scale farmers and their organizations in production, storing and processing of perishable products, and feeding, good nutrition and hygiene practices. It is hoped that these measure will ensure food availability during the “hungry season”.\nThe project will promote vocational training and rural entrepreneurship skills for young people and help create jobs for in the agropastoral sector. It will aim to reach transhumant pastoralists – Tuareg nomads - and also involve persons with disabilities in its activities.\nParticular attention will be placed on literacy activities and interactive training on gender issues and women’s leadership. The project will also encourage rural financial institutions to develop products that meet the needs of the small-scale farmers.\nSince 1980, IFAD has invested $350.7 million in 14 rural development programmes and projects in Niger worth a total of almost $746.1 million.

With small-scale producers grappling with climate change and COVID-19, food insecurity is expected to increase further in 2020. This threatens the livelihoods of millions of vulnerable Congolese.\nTo help the country address these issues, the financing agreement for the Inclusive and Resilient Rural Development Programme (PADRIR) was signed by correspondence by Sele Yalaghuli, Minister of Finance of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD.\nThis US$130.4 million programme will promote food crops such as cassava, rice and maize for climate-resilient value chain development, and groundnut, cowpea and soy to strengthen food and nutritional security. To diversify the income of small-scale farmers, PADRIR will encourage market gardening, fish farming, poultry breeding, beekeeping and livestock raising.\n“Today, the country faces many challenges – Covid-19, Ebola and conflict – and these are impacting the livelihoods of vulnerable small-scale farmers,” said Valantine Achancho, IFAD Country Director for DRC. “IFAD is committed to working with the government to ensure that rural areas are not left behind, and PADRIR is an innovative and inclusive programme that will tackle the issue of rural poverty holistically, with particular attention to people with disabilities, and the Pygmy people. It will improve access to basic economic and social infrastructure in its areas of intervention”.\nThe programme will also promote the economic inclusion of small-scale farmers and value addition to agricultural products through processing. Rural infrastructure will be put in place to support market-oriented production, and to enable efficient delivery of surplus production from small farms to markets, allowing farmers to sell more and improve their livelihoods.\nPADRIR will build the capacity of small-scale farmers and their organizations - not only in production, but also in storing and processing perishable products. It will promote vocational training for young people and help create jobs for them.\nThe programme funding includes an $26.6 million loan and $9.8 million grant from IFAD. In addition, the Government of DRC is providing $14.7 million, with a further $3.3 million contributed by beneficiaries themselves and international co-financiers and development partners have committed a total of US$75.9 million.\nPADRIR will be implemented in the four provinces of Central Kasaï, Eastern Kasaï, Lomami and Maniema. It will rehabilitate and construct environmentally friendly infrastructure – 180 water points including boreholes, drinking water supply systems and 14 micro hydroelectric plants and solar panel kits. In addition, 1,530 kilometres of roads and bridges will be rehabilitated; 44 warehouses, 68 healthcare centres and rural hospitals, 35 nutrition centres and 70 primary and secondary schools will be rehabilitated or constructed. The project will aim to have 60 per cent women among its beneficiaries.\nSince 1980, IFAD has invested more than $213.7 million in nine rural development programmes and projects in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, worth a total of almost $421.2 million.

Tens of millions have joined the ranks of the chronically undernourished over the past five years, and countries around the world continue to struggle with multiple forms of malnutrition.\nThe latest edition of theState of Food Security and Nutrition in the World,published today, estimates that almost 690 million people went hungry in 2019 – up by 10 million from 2018, and by nearly 60 million in five years. High costs and low affordability also mean billions cannot eat healthily or nutritiously. The hungry are most numerous in Asia, but expanding fastest in Africa. Across the planet, the report forecasts, the COVID-19 pandemic could tip over 130 million more people into chronic hunger by the end of 2020. (Flare-ups of acute hunger in the pandemic context may see this number escalate further at times.)\nTheState of Food Securityand Nutrition in the Worldis the most authoritative global study tracking progress towards ending hunger and malnutrition. It is produced jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\nWriting in the Foreword, the heads of the five agencies[i]warn that “five years after the world committed to end hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition, we are still off track to achieve this objective by 2030.”\nThe hunger numbers explained\nIn this edition, critical data updates for China and other populous countries[ii]have led to a substantial cut in estimates of the global number of hungry people, to the current 690 million. Nevertheless, there has been no change in the trend. Revising the entire hunger series back to the year 2000 yields the same conclusion: after steadily diminishing for decades, chronic hunger slowly began to rise in 2014 and continues to do so.\nAsia remains home to the greatest number of undernourished (381 million). Africa is second (250 million), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (48 million). The global prevalence of undernourishment – or overall percentage of hungry people – has changed little at 8.9 percent, but the absolute numbers have been rising since 2014. This means that over the last five years, hunger has grown in step with the global population.\nThis, in turn, hides great regional disparities: in percentage terms, Africa is the hardest hit region and becoming more so, with 19.1 percent of its people undernourished. This is more than double the rate in Asia (8.3 percent) and in Latin America and the Caribbean (7.4 percent). On current trends, by 2030, Africa will be home to more than half of the world’s chronically hungry.\nThe pandemic’s toll\nAs progress in fighting hunger stalls, the COVID-19 pandemic is intensifying the vulnerabilities and inadequacies of global food systems – understood as all the activities and processes affecting the production, distribution and consumption of food. While it is too soon to assess the full impact of the lockdowns and other containment measures, the report estimates that at a minimum, another 83 million people, and possibly as many as 132 million, may go hungry in 2020 as a result of the economic recession triggered by COVID-19.[iii]The setback throws into further doubt the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 2 (Zero Hunger).\nUnhealthy diets, food insecurity and malnutrition\nOvercoming hunger and malnutrition in all its forms (including undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, overweight and obesity) is about more than securing enough food to survive: what people eat – and especially what children eat – must also be nutritious.  Yet a key obstacle is the high cost of nutritious foods and the low affordability of healthy diets for vast numbers of families.\nThe report presents evidence that a healthy diet costs far more than US$ 1.90/day, the international poverty threshold. It puts the price of even the least expensive healthy diet at five times the price of filling stomachs with starch only. Nutrient-rich dairy, fruits, vegetables and protein-rich foods (plant and animal-sourced) are the most expensive food groups globally.\nThe latest estimates are that a staggering 3 billion people or more cannot afford a healthy diet. In sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, this is the case for 57 percent of the population – though no region, including North America and Europe, is spared. Partly as a result, the race to end malnutrition appears compromised. According to the report, in 2019, between a quarter and a third of children under five (191 million) were stunted or wasted – too short or too thin. Another 38 million under-fives were overweight. Among adults, meanwhile, obesity has become a global pandemic in its own right.\nA call to action\nThe report argues that once sustainability considerations are factored in, a global switch to healthy diets would help check the backslide into hunger while delivering enormous savings. It calculates that such a shift would allow the health costs associated with unhealthy diets, estimated to reach US$ 1.3 trillion a year in 2030, to be almost entirely offset; while the diet-related social cost of greenhouse gas emissions, estimated at US$ 1.7 trillion, could be cut by up to three-quarters.[iv]\nThe report urges a transformation of food systems to reduce the cost of nutritious foods and increase the affordability of healthy diets. While the specific solutions will differ from country to country, and even within them, the overall answers lie with interventions along the entire food supply chain, in the food environment, and in the political economy that shapes trade, public expenditure and investment policies. The study calls on governments to mainstream nutrition in their approaches to agriculture; work to cut cost-escalating factors in the production, storage, transport, distribution and marketing of food – including by reducing inefficiencies and food loss and waste; support local small-scale producers to grow and sell more nutritious foods, and secure their access to markets; prioritize children’s nutrition as the category in greatest need; foster behaviour change through education and communication; and embed nutrition in national social protection systems and investment strategies.\nThe heads of the five UN agencies behind theState of Food Security and Nutrition in the Worlddeclare their commitment to support this momentous shift, ensuring that it unfolds “in a sustainable way, for people and the planet.”\nPlease read the report here\nMedia contacts for interview requests (several languages are covered):\nFAO– Andre VORNIC, +39 345 870 6985,andre.vornic@fao.orgIFAD– Antonia PARADELA, +34 605 398 109,a.paradelatorices@ifad.orgUNICEF– Sabrina SIDHU, +1 917 476 1537,ssidhu@unicef.orgWFP– Martin PENNER, +39 345 614 2074,martin.penner@wfp.orgWHO– Fadela CHAIB,+41 79 475 5556,chaibf@who.int\n[i]For FAO – Qu Dongyu, Director-General; for IFAD – Gilbert F.

It will improve family farmers’ productive capacity and access to markets in 101 districts of the Amazonas, Ancash, Cajamarca, Lima and San Martin departments.\nInvolving a total investment of US$ 71.1 million, Avanzar Rural funds include a US$ 24 million loan from IFAD and a Government contribution of US$ 41.1 million. The beneficiaries themselves will contribute the remaining US$ 6 million. The Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MINAGRI) will implement Avanzar Rural through its Agrorural programme.\nThe project will focus on developing the competitiveness and resilience to climate change of family farmers, in particular women and youth, who have historically been marginalized in economic decisions affecting rural communities. It will also spread the use of low-cost, efficient technologies for boosting productivity, accessing markets and mitigating climate change.\n“This project couldn’t be more timely: family farmers’ access to markets has been severely impacted by the pandemic and the lockdown, so we need to invest in restoring and improving food supply chains more than ever. Otherwise we could see a health crisis turn into a food and humanitarian crisis,” said Rossana Polastri, IFAD Director for Latin America and the Caribbean.\nShe went on to explain that promoting resilience is essential to fighting the tragic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak and that no country can be resilient without the contribution that family farmers make to food security.\nThe project builds on the achievements of theStrengthening Local Development in the Highlands and High Rainforest Areas Project(known by its Spanish acronym, PSSA). By the time it closed last December, PSSA had financed 1,167 rural business plans in 85 districts of Amazonas, Cajamarca, Lima and San Martín Departments, doubling the average income of 40,000 families.\nPSSA and previous IFAD-funded projects in Peru have proven that, with proper support, family farmers can increase their productive perfomance, gain access to markets and ensure the long-term sustainability of their ventures.\nAvanzar Rural will benefit 17,400 small agricultural producers organized in cooperatives and productive associations and their families, which represents a total number of 57,420 direct beneficiaries.\nThe project will also support the capacity of local and regional governments to pursue rural development, contribute to territorial planning and create strong commercial and economic corridors that will allow family farmers to sell their products not only in small local markets, but also on a larger scale.\nUntil the COVID-19 outbreak, Peru had one of the most dynamic economies in Latin America and the Caribbean. Between 2000 and 2017, its GDP grew at an annual average rate of 3.1 per cent. Per capita income almost tripled in that period, rising to US$5,960. The economic growth went along with social policies that lead to significant poverty reduction.\n“We have to make sure that all those economic and social advances don’t disappear because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic,” said Polastri.\nNote to editors:\nSince 1980 IFAD has financed 10 rural development projects in Peru that have involved an investment of US$ 356.9 million (US$ 170.4 million from IFAD funds). These projects have improved the life of 187,000 families from the poorest rural areas of Peru.\nIFAD currently supports another large development programme in Peru, the Sustainable Territorial Development Project (PDTS), with a value of US$74.51 million. IFAD is also responsible, in partnership with the Ministry of Environment (MINAM), for a Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant, the IFAD-MERESE project.

Gilbert F. Houngbo, IFAD President, and Alamine Ousmane Mey, Minister of Economy, Planning and Regional Development of the Republic of Cameroon met virtually to sign the financing agreement for the second phase of the Commodity Value Chain Development Support Project (PADFA II).\nCameroon has great potential to meet its food demand and improve the living conditions of the rural population. About 32,000 poor rural households will benefit from the new project, which will help small-scale farmers and boost rice and onion production in the country. The project’s overarching goal is to strengthen rural livelihoods for greater income, improve food security and nutrition, and integrate approaches to mitigate the impact of climate change.\nSmall-scale farmers in rice and onion value chains have faced relatively low productivity and income. The project will introduce measures to ensure the availability of quality climate-resilient seeds and other inputs, and more efficient land and water management, including the modernization of irrigation infrastructure to reduce producers’ dependence on rain-fed farming. It will also work to minimize post-harvest losses by providing adequate storage and processing facilities.\nThe project aims to empower women and youth who are especially vulnerable to climate-related events and other shocks. Fifty per cent of the project’s participants will be women, who typically have limited access to finance and production tools. At least 30 per cent of the participants will be young people, who often face high rates of unemployment.\nIFAD has financed the project with a loan of US$47.0 million. US$10.8 million is provided through domestic cofinancing, including US$8.7 million from the Government of Cameroon and US$2.1 million from the beneficiaries themselves. Additional cofinancing of approximately US$2.1 million from other development partners is currently being finalized. The project will reach 15 departments in the country – North, Far North, Northwest and West - an increase from the eleven districts reached through PADFA.\n“This new financing agreement comes at the right time, as we face the cascading negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Abdelhaq Hanafi, Country Director for Cameroon. “Small-scale producers are at the centre of IFAD’s work and investing in them is a prerequisite for ensuring food security.”\nPADFA II will work with 111 farmers’ cooperatives to boost the production and productivity of small-scale farmers, develop a rice and onion improved seeds programme, and facilitate access to rural finance and markets where farmers can sell their products.\nIt will address food loss by building 26 rice warehouses, 28 bioclimatic houses for onion storage and five collection and packaging centres for onions and by rehabilitating 25 km of rural roads for access of products to markets. Installation of two rice-parboiling units will add value to rice processing.\nParticipants in this project will benefit from training on nutrition, food preparation and better hygiene. And young people can look forward to the creation of decent jobs to support the transportation of products and maintenance of infrastructure.\nSince 1981, IFAD has invested $201.6 million in 11 rural development programmes and projects in Cameroon worth a total of almost $421.3 million. These projects have directly benefited 610,302 rural households.\nPress release No.:IFAD/43/2020\nIFAD invests in rural people, empowering them to reduce poverty, increase food security, improve nutrition and strengthen resilience.

The Facility is supporting small-scale farmers and rural producers to continue to grow and sell food despite COVID-19 restrictions in movement and trade, by providing timely access to agricultural inputs, information, markets and liquidity.\n“We would like to thank Sweden for its commitment to achieving a world without poverty and hunger,” said Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD.  “The funds will assist rural producers, particularly women, to continue making food available on the markets, ensuring that the COVID-19 pandemic does not escalate into a lingering food crisis.”\n“In the midst of the pandemic, we need to support sustainable food production to reduce poverty and achieve Zero Hunger by 2030. Small-scale farmers are in the frontline and they need assistance now,” said Carin Jämtin, Sida's Director-General.\nSweden also committed SEK 40 million (approximately US$4.6 million) to IFAD’sFinancing Facility for Remittances. This will help maximize the impact of remittances and diaspora investment on rural development, accelerate the transformation of remittance markets through new technologies, and promote financial inclusion so that families receiving remittances use their funds productively.\nRemittance flows, often a lifeline for rural families in the developing world, are projected to decline by about 20 per cent this year due to migrant workers’ loss of employment worldwide, and reduced access to transfer operators caused by the COVID-19 restrictions.\nAbout 80 per cent of the world’s poorest and most food-insecure people live in rural areas. Around 135 million people were recently categorised as facing acute food insecurity and malnutrition. It is estimated that this number could nearly double before the end of the year due to the impacts of COVID-19.\nMovement restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus left many small-scale producers without access markets to sell produce or to buy seeds or fertilizer. Transport and border closures adversely affected rural areas and disrupted food systems. The most vulnerable include daily labourers, small businesses and informal workers, mostly women and young people.\nSweden is a founding member of IFAD and is one of the 36 members of IFAD’s Executive Board.

It is also an economic issue that affects women and men. Without gender equality, communities cannot reach their full economic potential,” said IFAD President Gilbert F. Houngbo said today at an event to mark International Women’s Day.\nEven as India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a takeover of his social media accounts by women “whose life & work inspire us”, rural women in Maharashtra are using the platforms available to them – such as self-help groups - to build more prosperous lives for their families, and to define broader, more active public and private spaces for themselves.\nTheTejaswini Rural Women's Empowerment Programme, an initiative of IFAD and the Government of Maharashtra’s Mahila Arthik Vikas Mahamandal (MAVIM), has enabled one million women across all 34 rural districts of Maharashtra to organize into self-help groups (SHGs).\nToday, SHG members across the state are together making choices and identifying opportunities in the economic, social and political spheres for their improved well-being. These women have shown that SHGs are an effective means not just to improve the living conditions of poor households by starting nano- and micro-enterprises run by women. They are also forums for women to collectively address issues that affect women and to seek community-based solutions.\nNeha Nilesh Thorve, who currently serves as a representative in the gram panchayat (a village-level elected local government body), said that her SHG gave her the confidence to run for election.\n“My fellow SHG members know me and trust me, and I was honoured they voted for me,” she said. “At our SHG meetings we discuss their challenges and I can advocate for them in the village council. I wouldn’t be here without their support.”\nSushma Kumar Munde, gram panchayat member for her village, Dhaktevengao, saidmanaging the loan she took from her SHG allowed her to make decisions and influence her children’s education.\n“I’ve only studied till Class IX, but now I know women can do anything. I want my daughter to study and become an engineer, an officer –whatever she wants,” she said.\nAs a result of the Tejaswini programme, nearly all of the SHGs have been able to access formal credit from banks, and they have an excellent 99 per cent repayment rate - with less than 0.5 per cent of these loans becoming non-performing assets for the banks.\nAn added benefit is that by pooling their money together and loaning it to one another, women in SHG’s are supporting businesses that employ other women and open up opportunities for growth and advancement.\nNotes to Editor:\nFor b-roll video footage contacta.bennett@.ifad.org.\nIFAD has been working in India for more than 30 years.

About 35 per cent will be young people who face high rates of unemployment.\nThe $62 million project, which will provide the means for a six-year extension of the successful Smallholder Agriculture Development Project (SADP I), was announced today by the International Fund for Agricultural Development of the United Nations (IFAD). Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD, and Thabo Sophonea, Minister of Finance of the Kingdom of Lesotho, signed the financing agreement for the Smallholder Agriculture Development Project (SADP II) by correspondence.\nThe total project financing amounts to $62 million, with $50 million from the World Bank and a $5 million loan from IFAD.

It aims to empower women and youth who are especially vulnerable to climate-related events and other shocks. According to the International Labour Organization, 38.5 per cent of young people in Lesotho, aged 15-24, are unemployed. The creation of sustainable rural employment opportunities will lead to increased incomes and greater long-term resilience.\n“In the face of COVID-19, it is even more important that we not allow that progress achieved against poverty during SADP I be lost, or that hunger be allowed to increase,” said Philipp Baumgartner, Country Director for Lesotho. “Small-scale farmers need greater support so that food production, processing and marketing continue, contributing to the country’s food security and economy.

This sets the stage for increased investments in food security, employment, and rural economic growth, and is an important step towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nIFAD is the first fund in the United Nations system to receive a public credit rating. The AA+ (stable) rating was announced by Fitch Ratings, which also assigned IFAD a short-term rating of F1+.\n“The strong rating comes at a critical time when the impacts of COVID-19 threaten to push millions more rural people into hunger and poverty. This rating will allow IFAD to strengthen and diversify its resource base, and build global resilience to future shocks,” said Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD.\nAs the only global development organization exclusively dedicated to transforming agriculture, rural economies and food systems by making them more inclusive, productive, resilient and sustainable, IFAD plays a central role in the fight against extreme poverty and food insecurity.\nThis credit rating adds momentum to international efforts to catalyze additional financing to achieve the SDGs by 2030 and ensure no one is left behind.\nIFAD-supported projects and programmes are funded through contributions from its 177 Member States, investment income and reflows, as well as cofinancing from other sources.\nWith Official Development Assistance (ODA) under pressure in recent years, IFAD has been exploring new funding models to help it double its impact on reducing poverty and hunger by 2030, and meet the changing needs of borrowing countries.\n“Meeting the needs of all our Member States requires IFAD to develop a diversified, broader and more predictable funding base so that we can expand our financial offer for the benefit of our borrowing countries,” said Houngbo.\n“The credit rating will provide us with greater scope to forge partnerships including with the private sector, the public development banks that we will be working with at the Finance In Common Summit in November, and gives us the means to leverage every dollar of taxpayer money we receive, allowing IFAD to maximize its support to the poorest of the poor.”\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, there could be up to 132 million more hungry people in 2020 alone, and extreme poverty looks set to increase for the first time in decades.

Implemented by the Development Bank of Ethiopia, it will help farmers to access financial services, raise and diversify their incomes, improve nutrition and build their resilience in rural areas threatened by climate change.\nThe virtual launch involved project participants, government officials, UN and IFAD staff, including Solomon Desta, Vice Governor of the National Bank of Ethiopia, Yohannes Ayalew, President of the Development Bank of Ethiopia, Catherine Sozi, United Nations Resident Coordinator to Ethiopia and said Ulaç Demirag, IFAD Country Director for Ethiopia.\nThe funding includes a $35.1 million grant and $4.9 million loan from IFAD, with significant cofinancing from international development partners and from national financial institutions. The Government of Ethiopia’s contribution is $51.9 million and $0.9million from the beneficiaries themselves.\nEthiopia’s agriculture sector, which employs 80 per cent of the population, continues to suffer from frequent droughts aggravated by climate change. In 2017, insufficient rainfall during the rainy season led to catastrophic crop and livestock losses and left an estimated 8.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.\n”RUFIP I and II made major contributions, not just in including 5 million customers in microfinance institutions, but also in improving regulatory capacities in microfinance, banking and lease finance supervision,” said Solomon Desta, Vice Governor of the National Bank of Ethiopia. ” RUFIP showed that microfinance is a better strategy for financial inclusion of the vulnerable poor  - by comparison there are 5 million microfinance institution borrowers as against only 0.3 million in banks.”\nRUFIP III will build on the lessons and experiences of the first two phases of the programme, and will scale up delivery of rural financial services tailored to the needs of the most vulnerable smallholder farmers, particularly women and young people.\n“IFAD is a key United Nations agency in Ethiopia, having made more than US$750 million of investments so far and reaching 7 million vulnerable households. RUFIP III is also part of the UN response to COVID-19, helping to support smallholder farmers in accessing rural financial services,” said Catherine Sozi, United Nations Resident Coordinator to Ethiopia. “I look forward to the implementation of RUFIP III and its results and impacts.”\nThrough the project, rural finance institutions will be able to deliver an expanded range of financial products and services to a large number of rural poor people. It will also support the uptake of these products by rural savings and credit cooperatives and microfinance institutions through financial literacy training. It will also develop insurance products through the rural finance institutions to allow smallholder farmers to mitigate the risks related to climate change.\n“RUFIP III is really about people -- it is not to simply make credit available to the rural population, to strengthen the microfinance sector in Ethiopia and to promote agro-industrialization, but to bring 13.5 million vulnerable rural households on a sustainable path to prosperity,” said Ulaç Demirag, IFAD Country Director for Ethiopia.\nDespite improvements, Ethiopia’s child malnutrition rates are still the highest in sub-Saharan Africa. The programme will also promote nutrition awareness through campaigns and demonstrations, targeting the areas most vulnerable to food insecurity due to climate change. It will also help farmers and small enterprises to enhance their resilience to weather related shocks.\nSince 1980, IFAD has invested $795.5 million in 20 rural development programmes and projects in Ethiopia worth a total of $2.1 billion.

At the same time, addressing the challenges posed by the pandemic provides an opportunity for countries to improve their agricultural production processes, enhance their value chain development, and transform their food systems.\nValerie Guarnieri, WFP Assistant Executive Director, Programme and Policy Development Department, highlighted that this pandemic calls for out-of-the-box thinking, along with the need for greater engagement among partners and the use of innovative service delivery methods to reach the most vulnerable populations. She provided concrete examples of how WFP is supporting host governments with innovative SSTC solutions. She also noted, “Here today, with the Rome-based agencies, and in the face of [ … ] growing needs due to COVID-19, we have an opportunity to mobilize more technical expertise from Global South countries that are managing the impact of the pandemic and are ready to share those experiences with others; innovation, such as digital modalities, can support more efficient brokering of SSTC.”\nThe country representatives at the event welcomed the proposed increase of SSTC activities on the ground, with a particular focus on value chain development, youth engagement in the area of technology, and collaboration with the private sector.\nThe importance of learning from and sharing experiences within African countries was emphasized by H.E. Henri Djombo, Minister of State, Minister of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, and Governor of IFAD for the Republic of the Congo. As he put it, “We have to turn towards other African countries and their experiences and successes and ensure the foundations for the development of agriculture through financing.” He also noted the importance of SSTC initiatives in the context of cassava, particularly the good work being done by the Rome-based agencies to improve cassava production through innovative technologies.\nThe huge potential for youth to be a driving force in agricultural transformation and rural development was the central topic of discussion for H.E. José Ángel López Camposeco, Minister of Agriculture, Livestock and Food of the Republic of Guatemala. In particular, he stressed the need “to generate opportunities for young people, support them and break down the barriers so that they are involved in production processes in rural areas.”He added:“Youth has huge potential and we should tap into that. We can bring technology into agriculture through young people.”\nH.E. Niu Dun, Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture in Rome of the People’s Republic of China, reiterated his country’s support for SSTC and stressed the importance of collaboration among partners to fight the pandemic. Ambassador Niu Dun also underlined the plan of the People’s Republic of China to invest more in rural agriculture, to enhance its agricultural production, and to review its agriculture policies to ensure the best possible support for its farmers.\nOne key area highlighted by multiple participants was the need to increase the number of exchange of innovative solutions generated by developing countries for the benefit of other developing countries. There is great potential here for the Rome-based agencies and their development partners to step up their efforts to increase knowledge- and expertise-sharing, which remain invaluable tools for supporting small-scale farmers.\n“SSTC is central in the activities that we carry out in the ACP countries. The COVID-19 threats cannot be successfully addressed independently by one country, region or continent,” said Escipión Joaquín Oliveira Gómez, Assistant Secretary General for Structural Economic Transformation and Trade of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. Touching on the central role of private sector actors in SSTC, he added: “We believe that private sector collaboration is essential to this work. Agricultural production in our countries plays a critical role to improve livelihoods.”\nThree years after the release of theJoint Roadmap towards BAPA+40: Strengthening collaboration among Rome-based Agencies on South-South and Triangular Cooperation, the representatives of FAO, IFAD and WFP renewed their commitment to working together to achieve the Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals by promoting and leveraging SSTC activities on the ground.\nContacts\nFor more information, visit theevent page.\n", "abstract": "\nOn 16 September, the United Nations Rome-based agencies − the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), IFAD and the World Food ..."},

Para la región, la necesidad de garantizar a su población en rápido crecimiento un acceso seguro a productos alimentarios básicos, pero también de calidad, supone una presión cada vez mayor”, sostuvo la Sra. Dina Saleh, Directora Regional de la División del Cercano Oriente, África del Norte y Europa del FIDA.\n“El acto de hoy consiste en un diálogo con 16 países asociados sobre la manera de aunar nuestros esfuerzos para superar desafíos tales como las situaciones de fragilidad, la migración, la seguridad alimentaria y la escasez de agua, que están obstaculizando el desarrollo rural sostenible en la región”.\nA la sesión, titulada “Intensificar la actuación del FIDA en favor de una transformación rural inclusiva y sostenible en la región árabe”, asistirán representantes de Arabia Saudita, Argelia, Egipto, los Emiratos Árabes Unidos, Iraq, Jordania, Kuwait, el Líbano, Libia, Marruecos, Omán, Qatar, Siria, Sudán, Túnez y el Yemen.\nEl encuentro se celebra en el contexto de la Duodécima Reposición de los Recursos del FIDA, período para el que la organización pide a los Estados Miembros que aumenten su financiación para que el Fondo pueda duplicar su impacto de cara a la reducción de la pobreza y el hambre para 2030. El diálogo virtual contribuirá a orientar y respaldar las actividades futuras del FIDA en la región árabe y sus actuales esfuerzos por movilizar recursos, así como intensificar su colaboración de larga data con los países árabes.\n“Es sumamente apremiante transformar los sistemas agroalimentarios de la región; el FIDA está adaptando su modelo operacional para adecuar su respuesta a la evolución de las necesidades de la población rural a la que presta apoyo”, afirmó el Sr. Ronald Hartman, Director de la División de Participación Activa, Asociaciones y Movilización de Recursos a Nivel Mundial del FIDA.\n“El FIDA está ampliando su gama tradicional de instrumentos financieros con objeto de incorporar herramientas más adecuadas para colaborar con el sector privado, y hacer frente a la vulnerabilidad climática y aumentar la resiliencia”.\nLa región árabe se ha visto afectada por conflictos armados prolongados, perturbaciones climáticas y una pandemia sin precedentes, que han agravado la seguridad alimentaria y la nutrición y han aumentado la pobreza y las tasas de desempleo.\nEn esta región se registran los mayores niveles de escasez de agua del mundo, y la agricultura en pequeña escala se ve cada vez más amenazada por las malas cosechas, lo que empuja a millones de hogares rurales a emigrar a las zonas urbanas, donde a menudo tienen dificultades para encontrar un empleo. Las tasas de desempleo juvenil se sitúan entre las más elevadas del mundo, y se prevé que la COVID-19 provoque la pérdida de 1,7 millones de puestos de trabajo.\nEl FIDA lleva desde 1981 adoptando soluciones a medida para abordar los principales desafíos que entorpecen el desarrollo rural sostenible. Ha invertido un total de 6 460 millones de dólares de los Estados Unidos (de los cuales, 2 180 millones provienen de sus propios recursos) en 132 proyectos y programas ejecutados en 13 países de la región árabe.\nA día de hoy, las operaciones del FIDA en la región benefician a más de 2 millones de personas del medio rural, cuya inversión total asciende a 1 560 millones de dólares de los Estados Unidos.\n\n\nEl FIDA invierte en la población rural y, al empoderar a estas personas, las ayuda a reducir la pobreza, aumentar la seguridad alimentaria, mejorar la nutrición y fortalecer la resiliencia.

Houngbo, President of the UN’s International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) in a strong call to governments to increase their investments in rural women.\n“It is unacceptable that rural women, who play such a vital role in growing our food and building thriving economies, are at greatest risk during the pandemic,” said Houngbo on the occasion of the International Day of Rural Women. “Our global resilience depends on governments paying greater attention to the disproportionate socio-economic impacts on rural women and stepping up their investments to protect them.”\nThere are approximately 1.7 billion women and girls living in rural areas, representing more than one-fifth of all humanity. Rural women make up 43 per cent of the agricultural work force in developing countries, and are responsible for much of the world’s food production. However they have less access than men to technologies, markets, financial assets and agricultural resources, making them far more vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-19.\nRestrictions on movement have limited the ability of rural producers to grow and sell their produce. Rural women, who are often employed informally with no social protection, have faced higher job loss than men, whilst also experiencing an increase in unpaid domestic workloads including caring for sick family members and children not in school.\n“Rural women – the people who have the greatest responsibility for feeding and raising the next generation – have been neglected through this crisis,” said Houngbo. “It is time to elevate the important contribution they make to their families, communities and the economies of their nations, and ensure that they are supported and protected through this unprecedented time.”\nWhile much progress has been made in the 25 years since the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action which provided a framework for addressing women’s empowerment, achieving gender equality in rural areas has been challenging. Women aged 25-34 are still 25 percent more likely than men to live in extreme poverty.\nNotes to Editor\nPress release No.: IFAD/48/2020\nIFAD invests in rural people, empowering them to reduce poverty, increase food security, improve nutrition and strengthen resilience.

They are the ones who work in the informal sector and are at most risk of being unemployed. They are the ones without social safety nets. But they are also the ones growing the food for urban and rural communities,” said van Ginneneken, who has dedicated her professional career to fighting poverty, most recently as Chief Executive Officer of the SNV Netherlands Development Organisation. “This is where we need to urgently invest.”\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, there could be up to 132 million more hungry people in 2020 alone, and extreme poverty looks set to increase for the first time in two decades. The impact is greatest in rural areas, where the majority of the world's poorest and hungriest people live – most of whom depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Rural small-scale farmers produce 50 percent of the world’s food calories.\n“When building back from the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has an opportunity to get it right,” said van Ginneneken. “Getting it right has multiple dimensions. One is to create a world that is more sustainable and resilient to climate change. Another is to be more equitable. This time we canot leave anyone behind.”\nIn her previous role at SNV, van Ginneneken oversaw the growth of the organization which focuses on the development of agriculture, energy and water in 28 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Prior to this, she held various leadership positions at the World Bank.  In her new role, she will lead the team that provides expert guidance on IFAD's strategic direction, thematic priorities and technical quality of the organization’s operations.\n“As the leader of the Strategy and Knowledge Department, I will be in a unique position to ensure that IFAD’s technical knowledge to build more resilient and sustainable food systems will be deployed in every country where IFAD works,” she said.\nIFAD is the only global development organization that works exclusively on eradicating poverty and hunger in rural areas.

Together.\n\"The present moment is again fraught with danger, complicated, and demands urgent action. As hunger grows once more, as the COVID-19 pandemic exposes the fragility of our food systems, history is calling upon us once more to rise to the challenge,\" urged Qu.\nThe Director-General spoke today atFAO's global 75th Anniversary/World Food Day virtual event in Rome, which brought together Pope Francis; Italy's President; Lesotho's King and Spain's Queen - FAO Special Goodwill Ambassadors for Nutrition; UN's Secretary General; and the heads of IFAD and WFP.\nSaluting FAO's anniversary, Pope Francis described the organization's mission as \"beautiful and important\".\nWorld Food Day is marked this year asglobal hunger risesfor the fifth consecutive year and a healthy diet is out of reach for 3 billion people. Nearly 700 million people still go hungry, and the pandemic could tip up to 132 million more into hunger by the end of 2020.\nThis year's World Food Day aims to galvanize and accelerate action towards ending hunger and malnutrition in all its forms, and to make food and agriculture an essential part of the COVID-19 response.\nChief amongst them, as speakers at today's event noted, are global solidarity and building more resilient, robust agri-food systems that can withstand shocks, deliver affordable and sustainable healthy diets for all, and decent livelihoods for all workers along the food supply chain.\n\"Now is the time to rethink our approaches and redouble our efforts,\" said Qu.\nAmongst these, Qu highlighted pioneering sciences and technologies, stressing that \"Innovation is our ally in re-imagining our food systems and ending hunger, as we are morally and politically bound to do in the next ten years\".\nPope Francis urged for more support for FAO's and all UN food agencies' initiatives that promote sustainable and diversified agriculture, and support small farming communities and the rural development of the poorest countries.\nUsing the money that buys arms and covers military expenses for defeating hunger and rural development instead would also be a \"courageous decision\", said the Pope.\n\"Hunger is not merely a disaster for humanity but also a disgrace... We cannot fail to respond or to act. We all are responsible,\" said Pope Francis.\nHis words were echoed by UN's Secretary-General António Guterres who called for intensified efforts to achieve the vision of Sustainable Development Goals - \"a future where everyone everywhere has access to the nutrition they need\". To inspire action towards this vision, Guterres said, he will convene a Food Systems Summit next year.\nNoting that his country was proud to host FAO's headquarters, Italy's President Sergio Mattarella said he welcomed FAO's and its Director-General's \"commitment to work with Italy and many other countries in forging a \"food coalition\" aimed at containing the effects of COVID-19 on food systems\".\nThis is the moment of \"crucial choices\", and of \"a serious global commitment,\" concluded Mattarella who expressed hope for the international community to rediscover a \"profound meaning of the valuable goods the earth offers us\" and the \"responsibility to share and safeguard them for future generations\".\nFAO Goodwill Ambassadors for Nutrition, King Letsie III of Lesotho and Queen Letizia of Spain stressed that healthy diets were everyone's right.\nKing Letsie III underlined that most of the people who cannot afford a healthy diet live in Africa and Asia, and called for \"concerted efforts to bring down the cost of nutritious foods\" so more people can afford them.\n\"The nutritional status of the most vulnerable populations groups is likely to deteriorate further as a result of the destructive health and social economic impact of COVID-19,\" warned King Letsie III.\nHighlighting that hundreds of millions go hungry whilst many more suffer from obesity, Queen Letizia said: \"These imbalances should make us think about how to strengthen food systems, seeking shorter marketing pathways to encourage local, seasonal, sustainable and small-scale production, a strategy that would also make life easier for many women in regions of the world where their vulnerability is extreme.\"\nThe president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development's (IFAD) Gilbert F. Houngbo said:\n\"We know that when crisis strikes, it is the poor and the vulnerable who suffer the most. We just cannot help but be aware of this reality and focus our attention on these most marginalized people, particularly in rural settings. At a time like this, these rural people need our support even more. But we also need them. If we want strong, healthy and peaceful societies, first we need to produce enough nutritious food for everyone.\"\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) was last week awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize for Peace, which many speakers today lauded as a recognition of hunger as a threat to peace and the need for the international community to turn its attention to addressing food insecurity.\nDavid Beasley, Executive Director of WFP said: \"2021 is looking very bleak. But I believe that if we reached deep into the hearts and pockets of the people around the world, we can perform another miracle.\"\n\"But as long as we have man-made conflicts, we will never end hunger,\" warned Beasley. \"It is critical that we end the wars, it is critical that we respond to climate extremes...If we strengthen the fragile governments out there, do the things we know that we have the expertise to do, I believe that we will be celebrating World Food Day in a way we have never done before because hunger will be at the end.\"\nEarlier today, the FAO Director-General participated in an online World Food Day event in Brussels hosted by the European Parliamentary Alliance against Hunger and Malnutrition, whose continued efforts to put food and nutrition high on the political agenda, he commended.\nQu was joined, amongst others, by the Vice-President of the European Parliament, Heidi Hautala, and the European Commissioner for Agriculture, Janusz Wojciechowski.\nHautala called for globalized and systematic solutions, innovation and equity as part of efforts to build back better and end hunger. Wojciechowski spoke about EU's Green Deal and noted the Commission's COVID-19 response work with FAO on food security and rural development.\nThis renewed sense of commitment and call to action today is all the more important as ajoint studyof FAO and partners revealed this week that we could end hunger by 2030 if donors double their investments and spend the money wisely.\n\"The scourge of hunger has been tormenting humankind for millennia. But we are the generation that can end it, once and for all,\" said FAO Director-General.\nThis year's World Food Day also honours allfood heroes, who - despite all difficulties - continue to provide food to their communities and beyond.\nToday, FAO and its partners are urging everyone to show gratitude for the food we eat and the people who produce, plant, harvest, fish or transport it.\nEvents in over 150 countries, including at Rome's Colosseum that is serving as a stunning backdrop for an FAOvideo mapping showthis evening, mark World Food Day and celebrate the world's food heroes and FAO's anniversary.\n\n", "abstract": "16 October 2020, Rome - Today,World Food Daymarks the 75th anniversary of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.\nBorn on t..."},

In many cases, they are affected directly by crisis; in other cases, their lives are made harder by the economic consequences. Often it is both. We have seen this time and time again.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, we are obviously concerned about the impacts on the poor rural people we serve. It is not yet clear to what extent COVID-19 will spread to the rural communities of developing countries, where more than three quarters of the world’s poorest people live – but we already know that rural livelihoods are being deeply affected.\nIFAD is taking steps so that rural women and men can continue to grow food and not fall into deeper poverty during this challenging time. And we call on our partners – especially governments, multilateral agencies, international financial institutions, the private sector, and civil society groups – to work with us for a coordinated global response.\nRegional trends\nThe situation is highly dynamic. At present, the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in the regions where IFAD works is most acute in Asia and the Pacific. At the same time, the Near East, North Africa and Central Europe region, as well as Latin America and the Caribbean, are also experiencing alarming increases in prevalence. In terms of the number of cases, the countries of sub-Saharan Africa have been relatively less affected so far. But measures to prevent the spread of the virus here, as well as knock-on economic impacts from the global economy, are already affecting local people.\nHow COVID-19 is impacting rural people\nThe effects that COVID-19 has on people fall into three general categories: economic effects, social effects, and the direct impact of the virus itself. The way these effects are translating into rural contexts needs particular consideration.\nIn rural communities, access to safe, clean water is often lacking. Rural people, like all people, need to be able to wash their hands to protect themselves from the virus. But without clean water, many can’t. And small-scale farmers need to work according to the climate – they can’t afford to stay inside. Nor can they afford to stop producing food –the food they grow is needed more than ever.\nAs another alarming effect, medicine and health care are less likely to be accessible to rural people who catch the virus. But with COVID-19, anyone who develops serious illness needs treatment within hours.\nRestrictions on trade and movement are already making it difficult for small-scale farmers to access markets, both to obtain essential inputs such as seeds and to sell final products. In some places, the lack of availability of seasonal labour will impede production, especially for labour-intensive foods such as fruits and vegetables. In addition, the availability of non-farm work that many rural households rely on to diversify their incomes is likely to shrink, as are incomes from remittances.\nIt will be the most marginal and poor groups who suffer the most – among them, rural women and young people. School closures and the need to care for sick family members will increase the workloads of many women. Many women will also suffer as unemployment rises, as their current work is more likely to be under informal and precarious workingconditions. Similarly, young people, who have greater difficulty than older adults in finding decent jobs, are even more likely to become excluded and disenfranchised.\nProtecting and enabling the most vulnerable in a time of crisis\nAs we respond to the crisis, we are driven by the principles ensuring that IFAD's support is feasible, flexible and does no harm. And we are reaching out to our partners – both at country and global level – to ensure coordinated actions.\nWe have already started repurposing resources wherever possible within our projects to protect the lives and livelihoods of rural people. We are providing immediate needs such as seeds and fertilizer and linking farmers to buyers at a time when movement restrictions are closing down some local markets. And we are working with farmers and microfinance providers to provide flexible options that allow farmers to access and repay loans during the crisis. We are also looking at a major initiative to expand our support to digital platforms servicing rural communities at a time when normal access to information is difficult. And we are adjusting the way we work so we can respond quickly and flexibly.\n", "abstract": "Whenever crisis strikes, it is invariably the poor and thevulnerable who suffermost.

This is why our programmes work to empower women so they can be financially self-sufficient and make their own decisions. By giving women and men an equal voice and an equal say on issues affecting their families and communities we can eradicate hunger and malnutrition,\" said WFP Assistant Executive Director, Manoj Juneja.\nWomen, especially in rural areas, are instrumental in the fight against hunger and malnutrition and in making food systems more productive and sustainable.\nThey grow food, reduce food losses, make diets more diverse and agricultural produce more marketable along the agri-food value chains. Yet, in many parts of the world women continue to face significant social and economic discrimination.\nThey often lack access to productive resources, agricultural inputs, information, finance, services, markets, social protection as well as technological and entrepreneurial know-how. In addition, many rural women are the primary caretakers in their households, which means they face heavy workloads that undermine their productive capacity and overall well-being.\nWhen rural women are empowered, the results are palpable\nFAO, IFAD and WFP know from experience that when rural women have better access to resources, services, economic opportunities and decision making, the results are palpable: communities have more food, their nutrition status improves, rural incomes increase and food systems become more efficient and sustainable.\nFor example, nearly 50,000 people (two thirds of them women) and, by extension, over 300,000 family members across seven countries (Ethiopia, Guatemala, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Nepal, Niger and Rwanda) increased their agricultural production and their families' nutrition status as well as their incomes thanks to a joint FAO, IFAD, WFP and UN Women programme that entailed capacity development, technical support and the promotion of gender-responsive approaches in rural institutions and gender-sensitive agricultural policies.\nDespite some progress, change has been slow for most of the world's women and girls\nThe three Rome-based UN agencies also note that there are still gaps in our knowledge about the differences between men and women in terms of their roles and opportunities in agriculture, and how gender disparities play out in different ecological, cultural and political contexts.\nWhat is well known, however, is that rural women are disproportionately vulnerable to food insecurity as well as economic and environmental shocks. Furthermore, harmful social norms and stereotypes on what women can or should do persist in many parts of the world, but these are difficult to address through conventional interventions. Food taboos that are detrimental to women's health and nutrition are still prevalent in many countries. In some areas of Africa or Asia, for example, pregnant and nursing women are not allowed to eat certain nutritious foods, such as fish.\nOverall, despite some progress, change has been slow for most of the world's women and girls. Not one single country can claim to have achieved gender equality.\nEvents marking this year's IWD present opportunities to mobilize global action to achieve gender equality and all women's and girls' human rights.\nThe event hosted by FAO today brings together representatives of the UN agencies' member states, gender experts, representatives of civil society and others to discuss how we can close the existing gender gaps in agriculture and rural livelihoods. The event also showcases good practices in establishing national policies and programmes for promoting gender equality and rural women's empowerment.\nGender equality in the food and agriculture sectors - facts and figures:\nNote to editors:a video news release on a women-focused project supported by FAO is available onFAO's Media Vault.\nThe project focuses on supporting women clam harvesters to earn more for their labour, whilst making their harvesting practices more sustainable.\n\n\nThe 2020 IWD theme is aligned with UN Women's new multigenerational campaign, Generation Equality, which marks the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the most progressive roadmap for the empowerment of women and girls.\n", "abstract": "6 March 2020, Rome- The three United Nations' Rome-based agencies dedicated to food and agriculture called today for bolder action to achieve gender e..."},

Houngbo, President of IFAD, said:\n“Developing countries are already particularly vulnerable to this pandemic as a health crisis. Unless we act now and act quickly, this will also become a major food and hunger crisis. COVID-19 confirms what we know from Ebola, SARS and other crises: that our world is one world, and that the impact of disease, climate change, poverty, hunger and inequality cannot be contained within a country or region. The ripple effects touch us all – but have an especially devastating impact on those already poor and hungry. We need to invest inthem and keeping food systems running through this pandemic, so that the world’s most vulnerable people can still feed their families and earn an income.”\n\nThe Elbas, designated today as UN Goodwill Ambassadors for IFAD, visited IFAD-supported projects in rural Sierra Leone in December. During their visit, they heard from farmers and representatives of rural communities who had received support from IFAD during the Ebola epidemic. At that time, IFAD-supported farmer banks were the sole providers of banking and financial services in affected areas. Their assistance helped the rural economy rebound so that farmers could continue to feed their families and local communities.\nSpeaking about their trip, Sabrina Dhowre Elba said:\n“This crisis has shown us we are only as safe as our most vulnerable people. It is in all our interests to keep local food systems going, protect rural communities and mitigate a health crisis as people who lose their jobs in the city head back to rural areas. The IFAD-run projects we saw in Sierra Leone give us hope that, with the right assistance, vulnerable rural people worldwide will be able to get through this difficult time.”\nIdris Elba said:\n“The world’s advanced economies are in the midst of this pandemic right now and, of course, they must do everything they can to help their own people. Every death is one death too many at a time like this. But the fact is, global action is also a matter of self-interest. As long as the pandemic is still raging anywhere, it will pose a threat everywhere.IFAD needs more assistance to carry on the work that is desperately needed to keep food systems operating in rural areas if we are to come out of this crisis together and avoid needless hunger and suffering.”\nIFAD has recently seen that food prices are already rising – even as productivity and household incomes are falling – in some countries affected by the pandemic.\nIn response, IFAD is already at work securing food supply chains in a number of countries by ensuring farmers can access seeds and other inputs; facilitating the purchase and storage of produce; and working with governments to keep transport routes open to farmers so they can sell their goods. It is hoped that these measures will help avert a potential food and hunger crisis – one that would have particularly harsh effects on vulnerable people in developing countries.\nMost rural farmers depend on small family farms for their incomes and sustenance. Rural areas are home to nearly 80 per cent of the world's poorest people, as well as the majority of the world’s hungriest people. In the developing world, small-scale farmers, working on around 500 million small farms, produce half of the food calories consumed globally.\nNotes to Editors\nPress release No.: IFAD/21/2020\nAbout IFAD\nIFAD invests in rural people, empowering them to reduce poverty, increase food security, improve nutrition and strengthen resilience.

It is the first time that IFAD, a specialized United Nations agency and international financial institution, is investing directly into a private sector entity.\nUnder its private sector engagement strategy adopted in September 2019, IFAD can now directly fund private sector entities and invest in funds targeting rural small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) and small-scale producers’ cooperatives. This enables IFAD to fund a wider range of projects increasing poor rural peoples’ productive capacities, improving their benefits from market participation and promoting the use of climate-smart practices.  IFAD’s strategy also aims to attract more private sector funding to the small-scale agriculture sector.\n“The private sector’s involvement in the eradication of hunger and poverty was crucial before the COVID-19 crisis. Now it has become even more important as we work to reduce some of the immediate impacts of the crisis and plan for a longer-term recovery when it is over,” said Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD. “More than ever, we need to join forces with the private sector to help small-scale producers and rural SMEs preserve and create jobs for those who are more likely to be left behind.”\nSmall-scale producers and rural SMEs have always faced real difficulties in accessing the funding they need to grow their businesses. With COVID-19, their situation could become even more precarious without necessary support.\nPrior to the COVID-19 crisis, the demand of $240 billion far exceeded the available supply of about $70 billion, leaving a funding gap of roughly $170 billion. About 70 per cent of the demand of approximately 270 million small producers in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and South and South-East Asia was unmet.\n“Small-scale farmers and rural SMEs are the backbone of the economy of their countries. They have a very high potential for growth and can create jobs – especially for the youth - and drive development in their communities and countries, but they need resources to invest,” added Houngbo.\nThe ABC Fund catalyses blended capital and invests in underserved segments of agribusiness value chains focusing on farmer organizations, financial intermediaries and agribusiness SMEs. It particularly targets commercially viable ventures that can help create employment, in particular for youth and women, and improve rural livelihoods. The fund also prioritizes climate-smart projects that promote sustainable production.\nOriginally sponsored by IFAD in 2019, the ABC Fund, now an independent private investment fund, is structured to blend public with private capital. It also provides technical assistance to investees through a dedicated facility. It received contributions from the European Commission, the Organisation of Africa, Caribbean and Pacific States, Luxembourg and the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa. It has a target size of €200 million. The ABC Fund is managed by Bamboo Capital Partners, a commercial private equity firm with a specialisation in impact investments.\nIn December 2019, the ABC Fund disbursed its first investment to a cooperative in Côte d’Ivoire collecting and marketing cocoa from and for its small producer members, benefiting over 2,700 cocoa farmers. Additional investments have been since approved   and more are planned in the coming months benefiting cooperatives, SMEs, savings and credit cooperatives and micro-finance institutions.\nIFAD’s investment in the ABC Fund is part of a wider plan to scale up IFAD’s engagement with the private sector and design innovative instruments to help increase investments in rural areas and help the private sector overcome the challenges of investing in small-scale agriculture, recognising that rural SMEs constitute an untapped business opportunity.\nRead more on IFAD and the ABC Fund\nUpdated as of 6 May 2020\nPR/22/2020\nIFAD invests in rural people, empowering them to reduce poverty, increase food security, improve nutrition and strengthen resilience.

On top of its own contribution, IFAD aims to raise at least $200 million more from Member States, foundations and the private sector.\n“We need to act now to stop this health crisis transforming into a food crisis,” said Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD. “The fallout from COVID-19 may push rural families even deeper into poverty, hunger and desperation, which is a real threat to global prosperity and stability. With immediate action, we can provide rural people with the tools to adapt and ensure a quicker recovery, averting an even bigger humanitarian crisis.”\nWith their movements restricted to contain further spread of the virus, many small-scale farmers are unable to access markets to sell produce or to buy inputs, such as seeds or fertilizer. Closures of major transport routes and export bans are also likely to affect food systems adversely. As entire production chains are disrupted and unemployment rises, the most vulnerable include daily labourers, small businesses and informal workers, who are very often women and young people. The return of workers from cities affected by lockdowns will put further strain on rural households, which will also stop receiving much needed remittances.\nAbout 80 percent of the world’s poorest and most food insecure people live in rural areas. Even before the outbreak, more than 820 million people were going hungry every day. A recent United Nations University study warned that in a worst-case scenario, the economic impact of the pandemic could push a further half-billion people into poverty.\n“This pandemic is threatening the gains we have made in reducing poverty over the past years. To avoid serious disruption to rural economies, it is essential to ensure agriculture, food chains, markets and trade continue to function,” said Houngbo.\n“A majority of the world’s most impoverished people are already suffering the consequences of climate change and conflict. An economic downturn in rural areas could compound these effects, generating more hunger and increasing instability, especially in fragile states.”\nTheRural Poor Stimulus Facilitywill focus on the following activities:\nIFAD has significant experience in working in fragile situations improving the resilience of rural populations. For example, in Sierra Leone during the Ebola outbreak, IFAD-supported banks were the sole providers of banking and financial services in affected areas. They provided timely assistance during the outbreak and supported the renewal of the rural economy after the crisis passed.\nEven before the COVID-19 pandemic, IFAD was already stepping up its programmes and calling on member states to increase investments in rural development to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2 – ending hunger.\n“A timely response to the pandemic is an opportunity to rebuild the world’s food systems along more sustainable and inclusive lines and build the resilience of rural populations to crisis, whether related to health, climate or conflict,” said Houngbo.\nIFAD has received requests from governments in more than 65 countries to help respond to the impact of the pandemic. It has already adapted its projects and diverted funds to support this.\nPR/20/2020\nIFAD invests in rural people, empowering them to reduce poverty, increase food security, improve nutrition and strengthen resilience.

The International Food Policy Research Institute estimates, for example, that140 million additional peoplecould fall into extreme poverty this year as a result of the virus, while a recent United Nations Universitystudyprojects that global poverty could increase for the first time since 1990.\nThe potential impacts on already vulnerable groups are especially worrying, especially insub-Saharan Africa, where a large share of people are threatened by poverty and hunger.\nIn particular, the livelihoods of rural women and menare already being deeply affectedby the COVID-19 crisis.\nAs such, it is imperative that we act fast.\nIt is also imperative that we act together. No country or person can isolate themselves from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic – whether that be from the virus itself or from its social and economic impacts. And no entity can find solutions to the crisis by acting alone.\nThat’s why the UN Secretary-General has called for urgent and coordinated global action to respond to the crisis, including through a socio-economicresponse framework– and why IFAD is responding within this framework.\nIFAD’s strategic response to the COVID-19 crisis is centred on a coordinated range of activities that address immediate impacts, prevent the erosion of results from past and ongoing operations, and put in place the building blocks to support post-crisis recovery.\nTo achieve these goals, our response is organized into four broad categories:\nIFAD’s country teams are already working with governments to find immediate solutions within ongoing projects. So far, over 100 projects across 65 countries have identified measures that can be put into action as part of the COVID-19 response. In India, Mexico and Palestine, for example, there are plans to purchase agricultural surpluses from farmers to ease the effects of reduced market access. And efforts to improve access to inputs have either been planned or are already being implemented in several other countries, including Angola, Brazil, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Eritrea, Ghana, Indonesia and Viet Nam. These efforts draw from a wide-ranging set of options and are always tailored to the needs of local people in the context of the pandemic.\nWe have launched a multi-donor COVID-19Rural Poor Stimulus Facilityto provide a more scaled-up response to complement our repurposed activities. The Facility will safeguard the food security and resilience of poor rural people by ensuring timely access to inputs, information, markets and liquidity. It will be targeted first and foremost at IFAD’s project beneficiaries, to ensure that the positive impacts they have achieved are not reversed. If funding permits, the Facility may also be scaled out to reach additional rural people in need. IFAD has initiated the Facility with US$40 million of seed funding from its own resources. To enable us to reach the scale needed, we aim to mobilize at least US$200 million from Member States and other donors.\nWe are advising and supporting governments as they work to mitigate some of the potentially most severe impacts of the crisis. In Bangladesh, for example, ourproposal for maintaining essential transport and logisticsfor agriculture has become part of the national response plan.\nAs governments begin to enact their long-term recovery plans, we remain ready to take action to support them. This means rebuilding rural economies and refocusing efforts with the aim of eradicating rural poverty and hunger in a post–COVID-19 context. The lessons IFAD has learned through our work in other fragile and post-emergency situations will be of particular value in this recovery phase. Key initiatives include supporting governments as they develop plans to accelerate recovery, rebuilding the resilience of rural livelihoods, and addressing structural inequalities so that, when the next crisis strikes, we are able to protect those most at risk of being left behind.\nAs COVID-19 continues to damage economies, societies and the health of far too many, we are determined not to allow it to cause more harm to the livelihoods of rural people. At this challenging time, we rely on the collaboration and support of our valued partners – governments, our sister UN agencies, farmers’ organizations, and the private sector – to ensure that the current COVID-19 crisis does not cause a food and poverty crisis.\nFind out more aboutIFAD’s responseto COVID-19.\n", "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting societies and economies.

Hunger levels on the continent are twice the world average.\nIFAD is the only multilateral development organization soley dedicated to eradicating rural poverty and hunger. In the letters, the African leaders called for a significant increase in contributions to IFAD’s Twelfth Replenishment (IFAD12) – a year-long consultative process during which Member States come together to agree on strategic directions and mobilize funds for IFAD to provide as concessional loans and grants to developing countries.\n“This support from the African Heads of State is a testimony to the real impact IFAD is having on the lives and livelihoods of rural people in these countries,” said Marie Haga, IFAD’s Associate Vice President for External Relations and Governance. “Their support demonstrates the importance of investing in rural areas to achieve national food security, environmental sustainability and economic development which has a monumental impact on global stability and resilience.”\nAbout 75 per cent of the world's poorest people live in rural areas and depend on agriculture and related activities for their livelihoods. In the letters, the African leaders highlight the immense potential of African agriculture and the strong evidence that investing in agriculture is one of the most effective ways of reducing poverty.\nIFAD aims to deliver an overall programme of work of US$10 billion for the IFAD12 period (2022–2024), with over half of investments allocated to Africa. This would help more than 140 million small-scale producers increase their production and raise their incomes through better market access and resilience, contributing to creating jobs and improving food security and nutrition for those most at risk of being left behind.\n“A successful replenishment has the potential to unlock billions of dollars in financing to transform rural economies and food systems around the world, as well as enable IFAD to double its impact by 2030 and contribute to ending poverty and hunger,” wrote the leaders.\nAs the pandemic sweeps across the world, the poor and the vulnerable are those who suffer most, among them rural women, young people and small-scale farmers.

Their efforts will complement insights derived frompast commissions and studieson agriculture, food and the environment.\n“Our 22 newly appointed commissioners include some of the most eminent experts and decision-makers from Africa, Asia and Latin America,” saidDr. Ruben Echeverría, chair of CoSAI. “They are uniquely placed to bring to light the challenges the Global South is facing in developing and adopting innovations that can help meet our food needs, whilst regenerating the natural environment.”\nIn many parts of the Global South, demand for food isquickly rising, resources are limited and external shocks – such as from extreme climate events – have become increasingly common.\n“We must listen to small-scale farming communities, operators of small and medium enterprises and others engaged in agriculture and food systems to understand how the pandemic has impacted them, so that we can introduce smart solutions at the local level to mitigate these effects and strengthen their resilience, now and in the future,” said Mbago-Bhunu, IFAD, Director East and Southern Africa.\nThe CoSAI Commissioners will follow a process of “open inquiry” – a process that will call upon a wide range of input – from farmer organizations to policy-makers, researchers, civil society and leading thinkers – to share their solutions to these big challenges, and debate the practicalities of implementation, taking a Global South lens.\nThe process aims to give more oxygen to some of the big practical questions in implementing sustainable agriculture intensification and spotlight some of the impressive work already generated in this field. CoSAI will also commission studies to fill in knowledge gaps, for example examiningcurrent investment flows supporting agricultural innovationfor the Global South.\nThe results of CoSAI’s work will guide global and national decision makers to support approaches to innovation that boost food production and access, ensure natural environments thrive, and reduce poverty and inequality.\nCoSAI will have its official launch in June, in aglobal web event, featuring prominent experts sharing their insights on the Global South’s food future.\nPR/24/2020\nMedia Contacts:\n\n\n", "abstract": "Rome, Italy  28 May 2019–  A national of Tanzania, Sara Mbago-Bhunu, IFAD’s director for the Eastern and Southern Africa Division, is among twenty-two..."},

Many women, men and particularly children living in rural areas are beset by food and nutritional insecurity, and the Government of Mali is developing policies and strategies to mount a vigorous response with support from technical and financial partners.\n\"Mali will never give up – neither Mali, nor the other countries of the Sahel. We are bleeding but we shall prevail. And we still need IFAD’s help to reach a critical mass, to add value\", said Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta, President of the Republic of Mali, at the opening of the 43rdsession of IFAD’s Governing Council. \"Regions where agriculture has benefited from long-term investments by organizations such as IFAD are more resilient. I congratulate IFAD for the results obtained thus far, and urge it to redouble its efforts to consolidate them\".\nThe workshop was opened by Jean-Claude Sidibé, Minister of Employment and Vocational Training; Safia Boly, Minister of Private Investment, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and National Entrepreneurship Promotion; M’baranga Gasarabwe, Resident Representative of the United Nations System in Mali; and Jean Pascal Kaboré, IFAD Country Director for Mali. The workshop was chaired by Moulaye Ahmed Boubacar, Minister of Agriculture and Governor of  Mali to IFAD.\nThe event kicked off the process of formulating the RB-COSOP (2020-2024) – to identify the strategic objectives that will guide IFAD support for Mali, in alignment with the national priorities set forth in the Strategic Framework for Economic Recovery and Sustainable Development 2019-2024 and other national policies.\nThe RB-COSOP will determine the framework for the partnership between the Government of Mali and IFAD. It will be aligned with the national policies on development and, more specifically, sector policies focusing on the cross-cutting issues of climate change, gender, nutrition and youth employment. The strategically selected operations identified in the new RB-COSOP for Mali (2020-2024) will also contribute to the three priority development objectives in IFAD’s Strategic Framework 2016-2025: increasing the productive capacity of poor rural people, increasing their benefits from market participation, and strengthening the environmental sustainability and climate resilience of their economic activities.\nThe COSOP will identify IFAD’s comparative advantage in working to reduce rural poverty, define target groups and the targeting strategy to be followed in interventions, set out IFAD’s strategic objectives in Mali for the coming five years, and outline models and innovations for sustainable transformation of the agricultural and rural sector that can be scaled up in the context of Mali.\nIn addition, the programme will define its contribution to achieving the objectives of the Strategic Framework for Economic Recovery and Sustainable Development 2019-2023 and the Sustainable Development Goals, together with a matrix to monitor results.\nThe RB-COSOP will be prepared under a participatory and inclusive approach, with close involvement by all stakeholders – representatives of government technical agencies; producers organizations including those of women and youth; the private sector; territorial collectivities; NGOs and other civil society organizations; decentralized financial systems; and IFAD-funded projects and programmes. The RB-COSOP is slated for presentation to the IFAD Executive Board in September 2020.\nSince 1982, IFAD has invested US$285 million in 16 projects and programmes in Mali for a total cost of US$607.9 million.

En ella se fija como principal objetivo promover la inclusión económica activa de la población rural para luchar contra la pobreza.\n“Compartimos la nueva visión del Gobierno de que luchar contra la pobreza rural de forma sostenible no puede hacerse sólo con subsidios, sino buscando la incorporación activa de la población rural más pobre a la vida económica de sus territorios”, aseguró Francisco Pichón, Director en el País para México del FIDA.\n“Para reducir la pobreza en las áreas rurales de México y de toda la región tenemos que crear oportunidades económicas e integrar a los grupos más vulnerables –mujeres, jóvenes, pueblos indígenas, sobre todo– a los mercados, siempre en coordinación con los planes de desarrollo de los gobiernos”, completó Rossana Polastri, Directora del FIDA para América Latina y el Caribe.\nEn México, este principio se concreta en una estrategia que busca aprovechar las transferencias de los programas de protección social del Gobierno a la población rural pobre y vulnerable para que esta sea capaz, además de atender sus necesidades básicas, de transformarse en agentes económicos activos, de acuerdo con los objetivos del Plan Nacional de Desarrollo 2019-2024 (PND).\nLas operaciones apoyadas por el FIDA trabajarán en estrecha relación con los programasSembrando Viday Fomento a la Economía Social del Instituto Nacional de Economía Social (INAES); el Programa de Fortalecimiento Productivo de las Comunidades Indígenas y Afro-mexicanas del Instituto Nacional de Pueblos Indígenas (INPI); el Programa de Inclusión Productiva de las Comunidades Rurales de zonas semiáridas, de la la Comisión Nacional Forestal (CONAFOR) y los programas Desarrollo Rural Integral en el Sur-Sureste, Producción para el Bienestar, Desarrollo Rural y Fomento a la Agricultura de la Secretaría de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural (SADER) entre otros.\nPara garantizar la transición de las poblaciones rurales más pobres de la subsistencia a la inclusión económica, las operaciones del FIDA complementarán los programas sociales que hacen transferencias de dinero a los grupos más vulnerables con el fomento de actividades productivas. Lo hará mediante el desarrollo de capacidades humanas, organización de los productores, acceso a los activos productivos y asistencia técnica continua para la consolidación de microempresas generadoras de empleo e ingreso en la población objetivo.\nEl FIDA ampliará también el uso herramientas para la inclusión financiera (mecanismos de garantías de préstamos y de aprovechamiento de las remesas) buscando oportunidades de ccolaboración con el sector privado en este campo.\nLa inversión prevista por el FIDA en México durante los próximos cinco años asciende a USD 94,5 millones que, sumados a las aportaciones del Gobierno mexicano, los propios beneficiarios y otros donantes internacionales (USD 50 millones) sumarán finalmente USD 214 millones.\nEn atención a las prioridades del PND, la estrategia se focalizará en los colectivos más desfavorecidos: pueblos indígenas, comunidades afro-mexicanas, mujeres y jóvenes que viven en condiciones de pobreza rural en los estados de sur y sureste de México, así como las regiones semiáridas del centro y norte del país.\nAunque México es la segunda economía en América Latina y el Caribe, el país enfrenta importantes brechas económicas y sociales. En lo que se refiere a las áreas rurales, aunque la agricultura emplea al 14 % de la población activa, representa menos del 4 % del Producto Interior Bruto mexicano.\nMás del 75 % de los productores agrarios son agricultores familiares cuyos campos no alcanzan las cinco hectáreas y que practican una agricultura de subsistencia basada en técnicas tradicionales que dependen de la lluvia. Casi ninguno tiene acceso a semillas mejoradas, riego, crédito, seguros, asistencia técnica, o infraestructura de comercialización.\nEstos datos se podrían ver agravados por el impacto de la COVID-19. Según un reciente informe del Consejo Nacional de Evaluación de la Política de Desarrollo Social (CONEVAL), el porcentaje de población viviendo en la pobreza pasaría del 48,8 % en 2018 al 56 % en 2020. El porcentaje de población viviendo en la extrema pobreza ascendería del 16,8 % al 25,3 %. En los próximos meses 10 millones de mexicanos podrían convertirse en pobres.\n“Si queremos paliar el retroceso de los avances sociales de los últimos años y recuperarnos del impacto de la COVID-19 tenemos que invertir en las áreas rurales por dos poderosas razones: en ellas se concentra la mayoría de la población pobre de la región y los agricultores familiares garantizan la seguridad alimentaria, algo esencial en la lucha contra la exclusión social”, aseguró Rossana Polastri, Directora del FIDA para América Latina y el Caribe.\n\n\nNota para los editores\nActualmente, el FIDA mantiene activos dos programas en México:\n\nEl FIDA invierte en la población rural y, al empoderar a estas personas, les ayuda a reducir la pobreza, aumentar la seguridad alimentaria, mejorar la nutrición y fortalecer la resiliencia. Desde 1978, hemos destinado 22 400 millones de dólares de los Estados Unidos en donaciones y préstamos a bajo interés a proyectos que han permitido llegar a alrededor de 512 millones de personas.

Houngbo, President of IFAD.  “With this support, more rural farmers, particularly women, can have the timely access to the inputs, information, markets and liquidity they need to ensure that the COVID-19 pandemic does not escalate into a bigger humanitarian disaster.”\n“We must act quickly to address the impact of COVID-19 on the most vulnerable communities, and Canada is responding to the severe food security needs brought on by the pandemic,” said Minister Karina Gould, Canada’s Minister of International Development. “Our investments will be helping to maintain food production and distribution, and protect the world’s poorest from the loss of their livelihoods and the serious health consequences of malnutrition.”\nAnnounced at today’s meeting of the Group of Friends on Food Security and Nutrition, Canada will commit CA$6 million to the Facility, on top of a $150 million highly concessional loan for climate-focused activities to the Fund earlier this year.\nAccording to theSecretary-General’s Policy Brief on the impact of COVID-19 on food security and nutritionreleased yesterday, the emerging global recession could disrupt the functioning of food systems, with the risk of a global food emergency if immediate action isn’t taken. The vast majority of the world’s population rely on local markets for their sustenance, which are often highly susceptible to disruption.\nWith their movements restricted in many places to contain further spread of the virus, many rural small-scale producers are unable to access markets to sell produce or to buy inputs, such as seeds or fertilizer. Closures of major transport routes and export bans are also likely to affect food systems adversely. As entire production chains are disrupted and unemployment rises, the most vulnerable include daily labourers, small businesses and informal workers, who are very often women and young people.\nThe Facility is part of the UN’s broader socio-economic response framework and it will focus on ensuring rural producers have access to inputs, markets, financial services and digital information to mitigate the pandemic’s impact on food production and rural employment. IFAD has already committed US$40 million in seed money and aims to raise at least an additional $200 million from governments, foundations and the private sector.\nAbout 80 percent of the world’s poorest and most food-insecure people live in rural areas. Around 135 million people were recently categorised as facing acute food insecurity and malnutrition. It is estimated that this number could nearly double before the end of the year due to the impacts of COVID-19.\nCanada is a founding member of IFAD, and has committed more than US$463 million to the Fund, with a particular focus on women’s rights and climate adaptation to better support sustainable agricultural production and access to markets. In 2012, Canada was the first donor to IFAD’s Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP) to channel climate finance to rural small-scale farmers. Canada recently partnered with IFAD in Mali to promote access to financial services in rural communities, particularly for women and young people.\n\nMore about theRural Poor Stimulus Facility\n\n\nPress release No.: IFAD/25/2020\nIFAD invests in rural people, empowering them to reduce poverty, increase food security, improve nutrition and strengthen resilience.

The evaluation report highlights achievements as well as areas for further improvement.\nIFAD- supported projects aim to raise the incomes and improve livelihoods, food security and living conditions of the world’s poorest people, who live in rural areas of developing countries. In the years after the 2009-2012 political crisis, IFAD-supported projects helped rural poor by providing them with the abilities and skills to improve their productivity and better capitalize on economic opportunities.\nSeveral projects introduced innovations into Madagascar, leading to positive results. For instance, IFAD was successful in integrating a large number of microenterprises and small businesses into high-value sectors by pairing farmers’ organizations with market operators, which improved farmers’ access to the markets. According to the report, the creation of nearly 400 of these pairs attracted over US$5.4 million in private sector investments.\n“We are quite proud of our gains in Madagascar in terms of rural productivity, incomes and entrepreneurship. Linking farmers with market operators was key for improving economic opportunities in rural areas”, said Sara Mbago-Bhunu, Regional Director of IFAD’s East and Southern Africa Division (ESA).\nIFAD played a key role in improving access of rural entrepreneurs to productive assets, support services and financial services. The report states that IFAD helped create networks of service providers, and collaboration and support platforms, thus contributing to the development of rural entrepreneurship.\nCapacity development and training for young farmers helped them set up and develop their own businesses. “Approximately 70,000 people benefited from training and outreach activities, which are essential for the development of our beneficiaries’ capacities and the dissemination of improved production techniques”, said Fabrizio Felloni, Interim Officer-in-Charge, IOE.\nIFAD’s work in the country is not over, however, and he went on to describe some of the areas for future work. “The report shows that there is a need to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of the operations, by better engaging key actors such as microfinance institutions, better defining the geographical reach of operations and further strengthening capacity development and skills,” Felloni said. “Additional efforts are also needed to integrate the most vulnerable into the country strategy and programme. The evaluation recommends to fine tune targeting, providing more subsidies for income-generating activities and credit to help the most vulnerable people participate fully in these activities.”\nAccording to the evaluation report, the management of natural resources and adaptation to climate change impacts needs to become a key objective in IFAD’s next country strategy for Madagascar. IFAD is looking at how it can improve work in this area in order to ensure sustainability and improve the livelihoods of the rural poor.\nPress release No.: 25/2020\nIFAD has invested in rural people for 40 years, empowering them to reduce poverty, increase food security, improve nutrition and strengthen resilience.

Governments should take measures and do everything possible to facilitate the flow of funds during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD, on the occasion of theInternational Day of Family Remittances.\nThe economic sectors that employ migrant workers, such as tourism, hospitality and agribusiness, are being hit the hardest by the impacts of COVID-19 restrictions, resulting in many migrants becoming underemployed or unemployed. As a result, remittance flows are projected to make their sharpest decline in history, falling by 20 per cent in 2020.\nThe closure of remittance service providers during lockdowns has further exacerbated the ability of migrants to send money back to their families. An IFAD survey last month of the Senegalese diaspora in France found that about 30 per cent of those who stopped or reduced sending money home did so because their money transfer operator was closed, or informal networks were no longer operating.\n“IFAD is now tracking the impact of declining remittances on the ‘receiving end’ in developing countries, where typical remittances of US$200 to $300 per month account for about 60 per cent of household income,” said Pedro de Vasconcelos, the head of IFAD’s Financing Facility for Remittances. “While the reduction in remittances will not fall evenly across countries and communities, the impact is likely be substantial in rural areas where remittances count the most.”\nHundreds of thousands of migrants have returned home to their rural communities. At the same time, their families are also negatively impacted by lockdown measures that have paralysed economic activity and destroyed livelihoods in their countries of origin.\nWith both sides of remittance corridors being simultaneously affected, disruptions directly affect the lives and livelihoods of one billion people: 200 million migrants who send money to their 800 million relatives. Almost half of these families live in rural areas where poverty and hunger are the highest. This year, tens of millions of families who rely on the remittances they receive will fall below the poverty line, resulting in more hunger and less spending in education and health.\n“While keeping remittances services running through the crisis will certainly reduce some of the impact of the decline in migrant incomes, there urgently needs to be a greater reform of the system so that after this crisis ends, migrants can send their money home faster, safer and cheaper,” said de Vasconcelos.\nTo address the situation, IFAD is making the following calls on governments and the private sector:\nSince March, IFAD has led a globalRemittances Community Task Forcecomprised of 35 international organizations, inter-governmental bodies, industry and private sector groups, and networks of diaspora organizations, which is working on a series of concrete measures to help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the lives of the one billion people directly involved in sending and receiving remittances.\nTo request an interview with IFAD experts, send an email to:IFADNewsroom@ifad.org.\nPress release No.: IFAD/27/2020\nIFAD invests in rural people, empowering them to reduce poverty, increase food security, improve nutrition and strengthen resilience.
