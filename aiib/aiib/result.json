RZD owns and operates Russia’s integrated national passenger and freight railway network and is the largest commercial employer in Russia with around 900,000 employees at the end of 2019. This AIIB loan will contribute to the company’s efforts to preserve jobs and the working conditions of employees and ensure continuous operations. \nCovering approximately 85,500 kilometers of track, Russia’s railway system is the world’s third longest railway network, second largest railway in terms of freight turnover and fourth largest railway in terms of passenger turnover. In addition to transporting passengers across large distances, its rail routes link to busy seaports that service Asia and Europe, serving as a “land bridge” between them, thus contributing to Russia’s domestic and foreign trade. \nHowever, as with all transportation companies, RZD faces the negative impacts of COVID-19. In particular, long-haul passenger rail operations in Russia have been severely affected; in some months, the decline in passenger turnover reached 70 percent. \nThe project aligns with AIIB’s commitment to support infrastructure clients in responding to the COVID-19 crisis through the Bank’s COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility (CRF). With such support, clients can successfully overcome temporary liquidity constraints and maintain critical long-term investments. \n“With this project, AIIB contributes to the support for railway transportation services, which remain a socially significant and the most affordable means of transport for millions of citizens, and an efficient way to transport large quantities of goods and freight,” said AIIB Vice President, Investment Operations, Konstantin Limitovskiy. “AIIB’s commitment to sustainability has to go beyond just the infrastructure itself. It must also account for the people, both those who provide and those who depend on its services.” \nThis project is funded by the AIIB Crisis Recovery Facility , and is AIIB’s first approved nonsovereign CRF project in Russia. \nThe CRF provides up to USD13 billion of financing to both public and private-sector entities facing serious adverse impacts as a result of the pandemic. As of Oct. 15, 2020, AIIB’s Board of Directors has approved a total of 22 projects amounting to over USD6.645 billion to help 16 members navigate the challenges of these highly uncertain times. Other projects being proposed under the CRF can be found here . \nAbout AIIB \nThe Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is a multilateral development bank with a mission to improve social and economic outcomes in Asia. Headquartered in Beijing, we began operations in January 2016 and have now grown to 103 approved members worldwide. By investing in sustainable infrastructure and other productive sectors in Asia and beyond, we will better connect people, services and markets that over time will impact the lives of billions and build a better future. \n"},

Before the pandemic, Georgia adopted reforms under the EMCP designed to sustain rapid growth and ensure inclusion, job creation and resilience through measures to strengthen economic management and enhance competitiveness. COVID-19 has caused government financing constraints, creating huge funding needs for the ongoing implementation of reforms under the EMCP. \n“The loan provides emergency budgetary support to enable the Government of Georgia to respond to the pandemic more effectively,” said AIIB Vice President, Investment Operations, Konstantin Limitovskiy. “By providing financing to support mitigation measures and safeguard macroeconomic stability, AIIB’s response will help minimize losses and put the country back on the recovery path.” \nThe financing will enhance inclusive growth and competitiveness, invest in human capital and build resilience by improving connectivity and integration, diversifying sources of finance, and improving the quality of the education system and macro-fiscal management. \nThis loan is the second for Georgia under the CRF, following an earlier emergency assistance of EUR91.34 million approved in May 2020, under which Georgia’s health infrastructure and social protection measures for COVID-19 preparedness were financed. \nWhile AIIB does not have a regular instrument for policy-based financing or budget support, the Bank is extending such financings on an exceptional basis under the CRF to support its members through programs cofinanced with the World Bank or ADB. \nAs of July, AIIB’s Board of Directors has approved a total of 16 projects amounting to over USD5.9 billion to help 12 members navigate the challenges of these highly uncertain times.

It is a great honor and privilege to have this year’s meeting opened by His Excellency President Xi who—five years ago—set forth his vision for AIIB at our inaugural meeting of the Board of Governors. I am proud that this Bank has become an established member of the MDB family, with broadly recognized success. I also thank you, Minister Liu Kun and the Chinese Government, for the excellent arrangement for our Annual Meeting in Beijing. \nAmid the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to go virtual. We imposed social distancing to contain the virus. But even though we are far apart, our international cooperation has brought us closer through joint efforts to protect the health and well-being of our people. \nBefore being hit by COVID-19, productivity growth had already weakened substantially in emerging and developing economies. This pandemic has placed huge pressure on AIIB members, particularly lower-income countries and the most vulnerable. Incomes are down. Debts are up. Uncertainty remains. Unless effective measures are taken to reverse this trend, we will suffer the loss of a generation. We will not allow such a disaster to befall our people and future generations. \nAs part of the coordinated international response to the pandemic, we swiftly pivoted our investment strategy and launched our COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility. To meet immediate demands, we have approved nearly USD6 billion for public health and emergency budgetary support in 12 members. This brings AIIB’s total investment portfolio since 2016 to nearly USD20 billion. \nOur Bank is a timely creation. We have unequivocally demonstrated our relevance, potency and capacity to do what is required by AIIB members and their people. \nAs a new MDB created to improve connectivity and economic integration among its members, AIIB will adhere to its approach to development through investment in infrastructure and other productive sectors. Once the crisis is behind us, we will go back to normal and continue our mainstream business. We will keep our eyes fixed on our long-term objectives. \nOver the past four-and-a-half years, we have laid a strong foundation for AIIB’s growth in the future. We have injected new ideas that embed accountability and oversight into our governance. We have assembled a strong team of professionals who have built a robust project pipeline. Our close cooperation with other members of the MDB family has been greatly appreciated by our clients. Over recent decades, never has international cooperation been so crucial, and never has such cooperation proven so effective and so productive. \nAIIB has broad-based economic and social development as its fixture on our panoramic horizon. The world is changing rapidly. We provide support to cushion against economic shocks. We ensure growth is inclusive and sustainable. This will require all of our efforts. \nWe do not have all the answers, but we are committed to doing our part. We are supporting climate change commitments. We are cooperating across regions. We are discovering new ways to increase connectivity and strengthen economies. We are striving to build a world that is financially, socially, environmentally and economically sustainable. \nOur virtual Annual Meeting today will keep us closer and reinforce our conviction that we will prevail over any challenge or disaster of the worst description. Together, we will make the world better. Thank you! \n"},

Due to the pandemic, enterprises are facing a severe revenue drop and difficulty in meeting operational expenses and retaining employees. Banks are facing higher credit risk from MSMEs, leading to tightened lending. The liquidity constraints could pose long-term implications for growth and productivity. \nAIIB’s financing entails addressing the liquidity needs of MSMEs via reimbursable financial assistance, and supporting a portfolio risk sharing facility to eligible financial institutions to reduce the risk of lending to MSMEs and ensure credit provision during recovery. It is estimated that more than 45,000 SMEs will benefit from the financial assistance to meet short-term operational needs, with retention of more than 65,000 jobs. In addition, 5,000 MSMEs will benefit from loans supported by the portfolio risk sharing facility. \n“The project complements the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic’s measures to help address the funding needs of the private and financial sectors,” said AIIB Director General, Investment Operations, Supee Teravaninthorn. “By providing MSMEs with emergency access to finance during this challenging time, AIIB can help businesses respond to and recover from the pandemic.” \nThe project was approved under the Special Fund Window (SFW) as part of the AIIB Crisis Recovery Facility (CRF) .

In addition to having a large number of migrant workers, over 80 percent of its workforce are employed in the informal sector which makes it difficult for communities to maintain social distancing measures to contain the spread of infectious diseases. The government has limited capacity to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to public health emergencies and the increasing incidence of COVID-19 in the country has put greater pressure on the national public health system. \n“The unfolding pandemic presents an unprecedented global challenge and has widespread and severe negative social, economic, and financial impacts. Through the COVID-19 Emergency Response and Pandemic Preparedness Project in Bangladesh, AIIB can help ease the significant pressures and strains on the country’s healthcare infrastructure, systems, and supply chains and mitigate the risk of loss of life and suffering faced by the people,“ said AIIB Vice President, Investment Operations, D.J.

Focused on infrastructure-related bonds as an asset class, the AIIB Asia ESG Enhanced Credit Managed Portfolio will be comprised of corporate bonds issued by infrastructure-related issuers, including quasi-sovereign bonds and green bonds where proceeds are directed to sustainable infrastructure and other productive sectors. Aligned with the Bank’s “Green” value, the AIIB Asia ESG Enhanced Credit Managed Portfolio will include a strong ESG component. Bonds purchased under this portfolio will be screened, assessed and managed based on ESG investing principles that have been informed by AIIB’s Environmental and Social Framework . “We can unlock the greatest potential to mobilize private capital for infrastructure from institutional investors by developing infrastructure as an asset class and deepening the sustainable debt capital market in Asia,” said AIIB Vice President and Chief Investment Officer D. J. Pandian. “Integrating ESG standards into capital markets in Emerging Asia will help build capacity for and interest in responsible investing, which is necessary if we are going to build a sustainable future.” ESG investing is still in its infancy in Emerging Asia. Only a few AIIB members who pledge support for the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment come from the region. To help build an ESG market, AIIB will partner with an asset manager to build capacity around responsible investing by producing research on ESG investing based on knowledge gained from applying AIIB’s ESG framework. In the long-term, AIIB will engage with market participants—including corporates and data providers—to improve disclosure, share knowledge and expand ESG rating coverage in Emerging Asia. “If only a small fraction of the trillions of dollars currently under management by institutional investors were allocated to infrastructure projects, there would be a catalyzing impact on Emerging Asia’s growth potential,” said AIIB Director General for Investment Operations Dong-Ik Lee. “By setting up this portfolio, we hope to develop a proof of concept that over time will mobilize other like-minded investors to join us in cultivating an ESG market in Asia.” At the outset, AIIB will lead by example by deploying its own capital as it builds awareness for the benefits of ESG investing in Asia. Over time, it will support other investors to set up similar platforms or participate in AIIB initiatives, with the ultimate goal of establishing a robust ESG market in the region.

The Bangladesh Power System Upgrade and Expansion Project marks the first AIIB financing approved under the Bank’s Accountability Framework. This framework, which came into effect on Jan. 1, 2019, delegates authority to the President to approve those projects that meet the predetermined criteria agreed with the Board. “This vital investment marks the first project approved under AIIB’s Accountability Framework , which clearly demarcate the roles and responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the President in respect of financing operations of the Bank,” said AIIB President Jin Liqun. “Through the Accountability Framework we sought to establish a new model of governance for AIIB with an effective, strategic Board of Directors that directs and oversees the work of an efficient, accountable management, together creating a Bank able to serve its clients’ needs effectively and efficiently.” The project will construct and upgrade more than 46 km of double-circuit transmission lines and associated substations and line bays. The project will also improve voltage stability and reduce voltage fluctuations and the need to spread the demand for electrical power, allowing more residences and businesses to connect to the regional grid. The Bangladesh Power System Upgrade and Expansion Project is one of four energy projects in Bangladesh that have received funding from AIIB. All four projects are aligned with the Government of Bangladesh’s target to achieve affordable electricity for all by 2021. This approach will enhance distribution capacity, increase the number of rural and urban electricity consumers, improve efficiency in gas production, expand gas transmission pipeline capacity and increase power generation capabilities in Bangladesh. “Ensuring a more stable source of electricity in Bangladesh’s second largest economic center will encourage more businesses to invest in the region, creating jobs and other economic benefits,” said AIIB Vice President and Chief Investment Officer D.J.

AIIB’s outlook has always been global with founding members from Asia, Africa, South America and Europe.  We were delighted to see demand from such a diversified group of investors in the book and look forward to showing our global investor base the positive contribution that this capital will have in Asia and beyond.” \nThe inaugural bond benefits from triple-A ratings from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch, which reflect the Bank’s commitment to the highest standards of governance, enhanced transparency and accountability. AIIB has a Bank of International Settlements 0% risk weighting and its addition to the European Banking Authority’s CRR list of multilateral development banks was recently approved by the European Parliament. \nAIIB is committed to best practices and modern risk management; and it has implemented an economic capital and stress test policy framework to manage its capital. This is further supported by a robust policy framework providing for the institutionalization of measured risk-taking decisions by each business line. \n“The growing institutional demand for fiscally sustainable, revenue-positive projects and support for AIIB’s unique operating model is evidenced by the almost USD 8 billion of financings already approved by the Bank,” said AIIB President Jin Liqun . “By participating in capital markets, we can harness further financial support from a global investor base, which will enable us to catalyze infrastructure investment and accelerate adoption of ESG Investing Principles in Emerging Asia.” \nAIIB funds will focus on, among other things, high-impact investments that promote sustainable development and climate resilient infrastructure. Examples of projects AIIB finances include metro lines in India, clean water projects in Egypt and Indonesia and bringing electricity to rural residents in Bangladesh. \nMartine Mills Hagen, Head of Funding added: “Today’s bond pricing is a major milestone for AIIB. It is a testament to the Bank’s recognized credit quality, diverse membership base, liquidity, capital strength, and commitment to putting in place best-in-class governance and risk management. We have met 250 investors over the last 20 months, and we look forward to continuing our conversations with them as well as increasing our investor base. This inaugural transaction is an important first step in the establishment of a diversified funding program with further issuance to follow suit in the near future.” \nLee Cumbes, Managing Director, Head of Public Sector at Barclays said: “Barclays is very proud to lead the inaugural bond for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, helping magnify the entity’s reach and deliver on its potential. This is an impressive first, historic, step towards AIIB’s long term future in the international capital markets, ensuring a presence capable of supporting an important mission in Asia to foster sustainable economic development, create wealth and improve infrastructure connectivity. Congratulations to AIIB.  We are honored to have played our role.” \nTanguy Claquin, Managing Director, Global Head of Sustainable Banking at Crédit Agricole CIB said: “During the preparation of this inaugural bond, AIIB made sure that ESG rating agencies would have the opportunity to understand AIIB’s goal to finance sustainable infrastructure and recognize that it did set up the right governance and organization to reach these goals, including by enshrining these objectives in the bonds Use of Proceeds. This proactive approach on ESG rating agencies has been extremely well received by specialized investors. For such an iconic inaugural trade, it demonstrates the high commitment of AIIB’s management to sustainability and the ever-growing importance of corporate responsibility in Asia. CACIB is proud to have been part of this landmark transaction.” \nAlf Costanzo, Managing Director, Head of Fixed Income (Asia) and Origination, Syndicate and Distribution (Europe) at TD Securities said: “An exceptional beginning to AIIB’s funding program, this debut bond offering reflects the superb credit quality and appeal of AIIB. Fixed income investors across the globe demonstrated their commitment to the multilateral development bank sector through the diversified participation in this deal. TD was honored to work on this inaugural deal and we congratulate the AIIB team for a diligently prepared and outstandingly priced transaction.” \nLars Humble, Managing Director, Head of SSA Syndicate at Goldman Sachs said : “We are honored and thrilled to have been involved in the inaugural transaction for AIIB. This landmark transaction is the culmination of a fairly long process involving significant work by the AIIB team and they have been rewarded with such a highly successful transaction, which is a joy to behold.

In addition, the global central bank participation demonstrates the breadth and appeal of the credit to the highest quality investors. We’re confident that AIIB will be able to follow with many successful transactions in the future from this auspicious beginning.” \nKenneth J. Madill, Head of Syndicate (EMEA), Debt Capital Markets Centre (EMEA) Bank of China said: ‘It is particularly notable that the deal benefited from early Indications of Interest and anchor orders out of Asia that helped drive the momentum and subsequent pricing of this inaugural landmark global transaction.

The project will increase the country's power generation by almost 20 percent, helping to reduce acute power shortages in the country. This project is one of several steps AIIB is taking to support the development of Nepal’s electricity sector. The Bank has also provided Nepal with USD900,000 for the proposed Tamakoshi V Hydroelectric Project and USD1 million for the proposed Power Distribution System Upgrade and Expansion Project from its Project Preparation Special Fund which provides grants to support the preparation of projects in eligible AIIB members. These grants are part of AIIB’s overall efforts in Nepal to increase energy generation capacity, reduce the demand-supply gap, upgrade transmission infrastructure and reduce electricity system losses. “We recognize that power supply shortages in Nepal have caused significant delays in the restoration of infrastructure and services impacted by the 2015 earthquake,” said AIIB Vice President and Chief Investment Officer D.J. Pandian. “By investing in hydropower and encouraging further private sector investment in the country, we will help drive economic growth and poverty alleviation efforts.” Cofinanced with the International Finance Corporation, Asian Development Bank and other development institutions, the project involves a USD650-million investment, financed entirely by foreign capital. It aims to serve as an example of how to facilitate investments in the sector. “AIIB’s investment will provide much-needed, long-term financing for a vital infrastructure project,” said AIIB Director General Dong-ik Lee. “We are confident that our investment will demonstrate the viability of Nepal’s sustainable energy sector to other potential private-sector investors.” The Upper Trishuli-1 Hydropower Project is a 216-megawatt greenfield run-of-river hydropower plant to be developed on the Trishuli river under a build-own-operate-transfer model. The project will sell power to the Nepal Electricity Authority under a Power Purchase Agreement. Additional information about the Upper Trishuli-1 Hydropower project can be found here .

AIIB has approved up to USD50 million of equity in Oriental InfraTrust.

Oriental InfraTrust is an infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) formed by a major Indian roads and highways company, Oriental Structural Engineering (OSE) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Oriental Tollways. The new InvIT investment vehicle was established to mobilize long-term private institutional capital for financing roads and highways in India. India needs investments of USD4.5 trillion by 2040 to meet critical infrastructure gaps, according to a report from the Global Infrastructure Hub. Of this amount, India’s roads and highways sector requires an estimated USD580 billion. “AIIB’s participation is a clear indication of our commitment to mobilize private capital into infrastructure financing,” said AIIB Vice President and Chief Investment Officer D.J. Pandian. “We expect this to increase confidence in long-term investors such as multilateral and bilateral development financial institutions, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and insurance companies.” Oriental InfraTrust has acquired a portfolio of five operating road assets from the sponsors —OSE and Oriental Tollways — and will now be responsible for the operation and maintenance until the end of the concession period. The road assets were initially awarded to the sponsors by the National Highways Authority of India under a design-build-finance-operate-transfer (DBFOT) model. “This is a first for AIIB and demonstrates our ability as a new multilateral development bank to support and promote debt and equity capital markets by recycling and securitizing operating assets for additional capital needed to promote and accelerate India’s infrastructure development,” said AIIB Director General Dong Ik Lee.

President Jin pledged for AIIB, with the cooperation of its members, to become, “the Bank that connects Asia to the world,” highlighting the need for around eight per cent GDP infrastructure investment by its lower and lower-middle income members to drive sustainable growth. President Jin’s comments follow AIIB analysis pointing to a consolidated economic view that this level of investment not only meets basic needs, but also helps countries catch up economically. While estimates can vary, AIIB’s analysis points to many lower and lower-middle income members needing to boost infrastructure investment by a third. Jin continued: “A well-coordinated investment program in infrastructure and other productive sectors in low-income countries will boost growth…will create jobs and reduce poverty… will empower women. This will then drive a higher level of development where governments can afford more investment in education and health, ultimately realizing long-term economic and social achievement.” Underscoring the importance of a ‘greener’ approach to building infrastructure to accelerate Asia's socio-economic development, President Jin said, “Project implementation should be green. Operation and maintenance of facilities should be green. Overall growth and development stemming from infrastructure should be even greener.” President Jin highlighted the importance of partnership and collaboration with European countries, including Luxembourg, who can play a pivotal role in raising private capital to invest in green, transformative infrastructure. Using the occasion of the Annual Meeting, he announced AIIB’s intention to list part of its future issues launched from its Euro Medium-Term Note program on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. In his keynote speech, Luxembourg’s Minister of Finance, Pierre Gramegna underlined that the country’s membership in the AIIB “is a testament to Luxembourg’s long lasting commitment to multilateralism,” stressing that, “only multilateralism and international cooperation can ensure reaching the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 and tackle the challenge of climate change.” In this context, Pierre Gramegna highlighted the fact during the 2019 Annual Meeting in Luxembourg a focus has been placed on green and sustainable finance, “I am pleased that several seminars held during this year’s annual meeting will focus on the commitments of the Paris agreement and the future of sustainable finance.” Holding the meeting in Luxembourg, a leading financial center with the second largest investment fund center worldwide, “will help creating synergies in mobilizing financial resources of governments, international institutions and the private sector to achieve better connectivity between Europe and Asia,” said Minister Gramegna.

Prime Minister. Distinguished Governors and Members of the Board of Directors. Honored Guests. Ladies and Gentlemen. We in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank are honored to be invited to this beautiful country for our fourth annual meeting, the first to be held in Europe and outside Asia. I would like to thank you, Grand Duke, Prime Minister, Finance Minister and your people, for your generous hospitality. Since we arrived, we have been overwhelmed by and immersed in an atmosphere of friendship, harmony and liveliness. Luxembourg was the first among the European countries to join the preparation to create a new multilateral development bank. From the beginning, Luxembourg played an important role in designing and shaping AIIB’s governance for the 21st century. Three and a half years into our operation, it is time we came to Luxembourg, and to Europe, to inform our European stakeholders about how we have developed. Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna, I recall vividly our conversation on the creation of AIIB. Your insights and frankness touched me immensely. You were clear-cut in your position: What AIIB should be. What it shouldn’t be. What AIIB should and shouldn’t do. I am sure your ideas about the identity and behavior of the proposed bank represented the opinion and sentiment of Luxembourg and its people. Later on, when touring other European countries, what I heard from prospective shareholders convinced me that your words reflected the broader European perspective. I would like to take this opportunity with you here—Grand Duke, Prime Minister and Finance Minister—to announce AIIB’s intention to list the Euro Medium Term Note program on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. AIIB was conceived and born in Asia, but it owes its birth and growth to the wisdom and labor of all the founding members. European shareholders have prodigiously contributed to the creation of this new MDB. As a result, AIIB holds distinctively European characteristics. And—in adherence to our values of being lean, clean and green—we set the bar at par with the governance structure of other MDBs, of which European countries are founding members. Those values show that we have zero tolerance for corruption and that we promote the green economy. There has always been a strong bond between Asian and European countries. Asia and Europe share the same vast continent. We are physically bound to each other. Yet tough terrain impedes this geographical affinity, hampering exchanges in commerce, investment and culture. Now is the time to improve our connectivity in all its dimensions. AIIB is mandated to improve connectivity among its members and among the regions. But operations in infrastructure investment must adapt and evolve. Emphasis should be placed on a green approach to building infrastructure. Project implementation should be green. Operation and maintenance of facilities should be green. Overall growth and development stemming from infrastructure should be even greener. On December 12, 2015, just a few weeks before AIIB became operational in January 2016, about 200 countries concluded negotiations on the Paris Agreement. It was within this atmosphere of multilateral efforts to address the formidable challenge of climate change that our Bank was born. Climate change mitigation is crucial for all of us and, more importantly, for generations to come. There is no alternative but to tackle this challenge head-on. We are now faced with a global situation far more complicated than what it was three years ago. Overall, global growth is stabilizing, but protectionism and disruption of trade and cross-border investments constitute a major risk to many countries. Many low-income countries are particularly vulnerable to market turbulence. Their exports are likely to suffer setbacks; their debt sustainability adversely affected. The complexity of our global, political and economic situation should not inhibit us from investing in priority projects where our members need them most. Slower investment in crucial sectors will compromise long-term development. A well-coordinated investment program in infrastructure and other productive sectors in low-income countries will boost growth. It will create jobs and reduce poverty. It will empower women. This will then drive a higher level of development where governments can afford more investment in education and health, ultimately realizing long-term economic and social achievement. AIIB and other MDBs have a crucial role to play in this regard. Today, the world is not short of liquidity. Asia has consistently maintained a high savings rate, although great variance exists within the region or across countries. At present, risk-averse investors are allocating money to developed market equities—with major indices at or near all-time highs—and to low-risk fixed income. This is driving bond yields across Europe into marginally positive territory. The main issue is that the mechanisms for turning these vast savings pools into long-term investments is, sadly, still limited. Asian equity and fixed income capital markets are still at an early stage of development in terms of depth, breadth and impact. Infrastructure projects are typically large, require a long gestation period and demand a stable, predictable policy and regulatory climate amenable and conducive to such investment. Economists in MDBs, including AIIB, have done research and analysis on the constraints affecting growth in developing Asia. They still point to lack of infrastructure investment as the main cause. A converging view is that developing countries should invest around eight percent of their GDP in infrastructure. This is a level of investment that not only meets basic needs, but also helps countries catch up economically. For every dollar spent in gross capital formation, 40 cents should be spent on infrastructure. While some Asian economies have increased their investments to six to seven percent of GDP, other economies are struggling, particularly countries at low income levels. Estimates vary, but our best analysis points to many lower and lower-middle income members needing to boost infrastructure investment by a third. Unable to mobilize private capital for infrastructure investment, they must consider allocating public resources for that purpose without putting pressure on their public balance sheets. While it is important for developing economies to raise their infrastructure investment, it must be done sustainably, not least on the issue of debt. Public and external debts of many countries in Asia have risen. Especially so for smaller economies, where sometimes large infrastructure investments can increase debt-to-GDP ratios quickly. Investing in high-quality infrastructure is important. New investments must increase a country’s capacity to service debts, not just having debts to service. Quality means selecting projects with high economic returns, designing them well and financing them sustainably. Quality means ensuring that projects benefit the local population, do no harm to people or the environment and leave no chance for corruption. This is what it means to be lean, clean and green. For those members with a high level of debt, we have to strike a proper balance between budget control to ensure debt sustainability and well-coordinated, well-designed infrastructure investments to pave the way for long-term development. Commercial sources of capital may run shy from these countries, but AIIB must be an even more supportive partner capable of meeting their special needs. These countries should not be left behind. This is exactly the challenge facing AIIB and our client members. This is the very reason why we need to ramp up our concerted efforts to help these countries. We have a sense of urgency to fulfil our duty. Over the last three years and a half, we at AIIB—the Board of Directors, the Management and the staff—have worked together in close collaboration to make this Bank ready for the challenge. We have noticed that while existing barriers to infrastructure development are being rolled back, new ones are raised. This is a cause for concern. The collective wisdom, knowledge and influence to removing these impediments lies in this very room. It lies within all of you. Governors, Directors, policymakers, private financiers, civil society and media are all here today. By working together, we have the power to remove these roadblocks. Together we can create domestic reforms, perform policy coordination and think holistically about country and regional infrastructure and supporting facilities. Cooperation and Connectivity is the theme of our annual meeting for the simple reason that infrastructure is complex, particularly when it comes to connectivity projects. It will take all of us who are here today to work together to move the needle. We need concrete action today. MDBs are here to help smooth over these challenges. We believe infrastructure bottlenecks can only be effectively resolved through partnership. Through risk-sharing. Through international cooperation. I met President Malpass of the World Bank in April when I discussed with him the cooperation between our two banks and more broadly about the collaboration among all MDBs. I shared similar conversations with President Nakao of ADB and President Chakrabarti of EBRD, among others. I pay special tribute to President Hoyer of EIB, who has kindly hosted AIIB, our Board of Directors and Management this week. We are looking forward to deepening our partnership and cofinancing. We are going to expand our programs beyond Asia because Asia cannot sustain itself without working with other regions. We live in the same small village. We are all neighbors, irrespective of the oceans that separate us geographically. Governors and ministers, if we have not done anything yet in your region and individual countries, please understand that we have you and your people on our minds. We are moving toward you. MDBs also need to evolve and adapt to new trends in financing infrastructure. How we cooperate, govern ourselves and support our clients must not stagnate, or we risk missing opportunities. Many of our recent projects are evidence of our expanding capabilities. They show our commitment to partnership and working with our clients to bring well-designed projects to fruition: \nI am delighted that at this annual meeting, AIIB will introduce its variable spread loan product. This will give borrowers the flexibility to select interest terms that are consistent with their sovereign debt management strategy and suited for their debt servicing capability. This year, we will also introduce local currency products in selected currencies, providing more options to borrowers. Building off the triple-A credit ratings received from all three major credit rating agencies, we issued our debut Global Dollar Bond this year. Investors from around the world participated in the bond, and as such it priced at the tightest levels in line with our global MDB peers. This positions AIIB as a “premium supranational.” In December last year, the General Assembly of the United Nations granted AIIB permanent observer status. This is an important milestone for the Bank. That such a privilege was granted with the full support of the international community, including states that are not members of AIIB, underscores the high expectations that the Bank will make a real and lasting contribution to economic growth, development and enhanced connectivity in Asia. We are looking forward to our ever-growing membership. Tomorrow, the Board of Governors will consider, and we hope will approve, the membership of new applicants, bringing our total number of approved members to 100. This will be another significant landmark for the Bank. Collaboration and partnership must extend to all involved. AIIB is inclusive, open and diverse in its views. In this 21st century world, we must be flexible and agile if we want to achieve the great goals set out for our new organization. Now in the final year of our startup phase, the basic building blocks of the Bank are in place. We have achieved much in our early development, but a lot of heavy lifting still needs to be done. Governors, ministers and board members, we see it as our job to position AIIB to meet the challenges of today and the future. We are doing our utmost to steer our business to a stronger place with each passing year. I am heartened by your presence here in Luxembourg because I have seen the power of collaboration in action. Yet, we have only just begun. I believe the future for Asia is bright. With your help, we have become the Bank striving for connectivity in Asia. With your help, we will become the Bank that connects Asia to the world. \n"},

The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Black Sea Trade and Development Bank (BSTDB) are contributing to a financial package worth USD350 million for three new units at the plant. EFELER is located in western Turkey, in the region of the Büyük Menderes Graben basin, the area in Turkey with the greatest potential for geothermal energy. Gürmat Elektrik, a renewable energy subsidiary of Güriş Holding, is using the finance for the expansion at EFELER that will tap into locally available geothermal resources. Of the three new units, EFE-6 with 22.6 MW capacity and EFE-7 with 25 MW are already operational. EFE-8 with a capacity of 50 MW is still under construction. When fully completed next year, the plant’s eight units will have a total installed capacity of 260 MW. Under the financing package, Gürmat Elektrik will receive USD100 million loan from the AIIB, a USD 60 million loan from the EBRD and USD 20 million loan from the BSTDB. In parallel, Turkey’s largest commercial lender Isbank is providing USD 90 million loan, and the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey TSKB and ICBC Turkey are making loans of USD 50 million and USD 30 million, respectively. The financing is part of the effort to help Turkey develop local renewable energy sources and encourage private sector investment in the energy sector. Güriş Holding has also committed to providing more career opportunities for women in this traditionally male-dominated sector. AIIB Vice President and Chief Investment Officer D.J. Pandian said: “This project represents a number of firsts for AIIB: EFELER is our first nonsovereign-based financing in Turkey, our first co-financing with EBRD and BSTDB in the private sector, and our first investment in the geothermal space. It is also a visible example of AIIB’s commitment to the expansion of renewable energy projects led by the private sector in Turkey.” EBRD Managing Director for Sustainable Infrastructure Nandita Parshad said: “We are pleased to build on our previous cooperation with Guris Holding, a long-standing client of the EBRD with a strong track record of project implementation. We are also proud to join forces with AIIB, BSTDB and commercial banks and together provide a comprehensive financing package to the company. The EBRD is committed to helping Turkey develop and diversify its energy mix.” BSTDB Vice President Banking Hasan Demirhan said: “As a regional development bank, BSTDB seeks to considerably increase its strategic role in supporting infrastructure investments with high development impact in member countries, including creation of long-term employment and increased revenues for the state budget. This project is also a good example of our synergies with peer development institutions and private sector investors to increase the efficiency of development financing.” About AIIB AIIB is a multilateral development bank with a mission to improve social and economic outcomes in Asia.

Through a managed fixed income portfolio of an initial USD500-million, the joint project expects to mobilize another USD500-million from climate change-focused institutional investors. A portion of the investment proceeds will be allocated to market education, engagement and issuer support. Amundi and AIIB have developed a first-of-its-kind Climate Change Investment framework, which takes into account three variables, portion of green business activities, climate mitigation and resilience to climate change, to analyze issuers’ ability to cope with climate change. The Asia Climate Bond Portfolio will invest in labeled green bonds and unlabeled climate bonds and engage with issuing companies to help them transition their business models to increase climate resilience and green leadership. The portfolio will seek performance by identifying, analyzing and selecting tomorrow’s climate champions based on this framework. “This portfolio is another example of how AIIB works with leading partners to develop innovative financial products to deepen capital markets for infrastructure,” said AIIB Vice President and Chief Investment Officer D.J. Pandian. “We expect this investment will demonstrate how international financial institutions can approach development finance differently to support the Paris Agreement and adoption of climate finance principles.” “We are honored to work with AIIB on their first capital market initiative focused on climate action,” said Amundi CEO Yves Perrier. “Supporting Climate Champions and the Paris Agreement in Asia is in line with Amundi’s commitment to ESG investing and reflects our extensive commitment to the region. We are proud to launch this new initiative in the field of climate finance.” This project will also entail an ambitious engagement policy to support the emergence of climate champions in infrastructure and other productive sectors. “I am glad to see that a new financial innovation will help support the emergence of green leaders in Asia,” said economist and policymaker Professor Lord Nicholas Stern who also sits on AIIB’s International Advisory Panel. “This comprehensive approach favored by a new public-private partnership between AIIB and Amundi, focusing on the various dimensions through which climate change can impact businesses (including transition risks and physical risks) could help a great deal in mobilizing very large amounts of money for climate action and the energy transition in critical regions of the world. We should expect strong performance—more responsible investment and more modern techniques offer better returns.” The emerging market corporate debt strategy will be managed by Amundi’s Global Emerging Market Debt portfolio management team, based in London and whose members each have an average of over 17 years’ professional experience. This team is part of the broader Emerging Markets Investment platform, which manages $50.5bn 1 in dedicated EM Equity, Fixed-Income and Cross-Assets strategies and totals 69 investment professionals (portfolio managers and career analysts). In July, AIIB announced a USD500-million portfolio that aims to develop debt capital markets for infrastructure, drive responsible investing in fixed income and build a sustainable ESG ecosystem in emerging markets in Asia. The Asia Climate Bond Portfolio will begin investing in January 2020 and will progressively deploy the committed capital in eligible assets. Additional information can be found here .

AIIB’s President Jin Liqun approved a USD71.81-million loan for a project that will provide an efficient and sustainable public transport system in Pakistan’s economic hub. The Karachi Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project includes the construction of the Karachi Red Line BRT Corridor and associated facilities, as well as the establishment of BRT operations. An estimated 1.5 million people living within a one-kilometer radius from the BRT corridor and off-corridor services will directly benefit once the project is completed. The city’s air quality is also expected to improve, and greenhouse gas emissions reduced as passengers switch from private cars and motorcycles to the new BRT system. AIIB’s latest investment in the megacity comes on the heels of a USD40-million loan approved by its Board of Directors in October to improve Karachi’s water services, bringing the Bank’s overall financial commitment to Pakistan to USD512 million. This loan is geared toward upgrading the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board’s (KWSB) efficiency and sustainability. Once fully operational, an estimated two million residents will benefit from better customer service and reduced water losses. KWSB provides Karachi 650 million gallons of water per day, only about half of the city’s total needs. Due to inadequate water availability, rationing and leakages are widespread.

Ltd. (Clifford Capital) have announced the establishment of Bayfront Infrastructure Management Pte. Ltd. (BIM), a first-of-its-kind platform designed to mobilize a new pool of institutional capital for infrastructure debt in Asia. AIIB and Clifford Capital will take a 30-percent and 70-percent equity stake in BIM, respectively. BIM’s objective is to address the infrastructure financing gap in the Asia-Pacific region. This will be achieved by facilitating the mobilization of private institutional capital into the infrastructure financing market. It will unlock capital for infrastructure financing by facilitating the recycling of capital and liquidity by banks that have traditionally been the largest lenders in this sector. BIM will acquire predominantly brownfield project and infrastructure loans from financial institutions, warehouse and manage them, with the objective of distributing securitized notes to institutional investors in the public markets. BIM will also sponsor, structure and manage such distribution issuances and invest in the equity tranches or vertical slices of its securitization issuances to demonstrate alignment of interest with investors. The platform will benefit existing bank lenders as it relieves their capital constraints by purchasing on-balance sheet exposures. It also provides global institutional investors with unique access to a diversified project and infrastructure loan portfolio through a new investable asset class that is more accessible. Debt instruments issued by BIM to acquire and warehouse loans from banks are expected to benefit from a guarantee provided by the Government of Singapore (Government Guarantee). This Government Guarantee will not cover the securitized products BIM will structure and distribute to investors. The establishment of BIM builds on the successful issuance of Asia’s first securitization of project finance and infrastructure loans through Bayfront Infrastructure Capital (BIC), launched in Singapore in 2018. The BIC transaction demonstrated the viability of the Infrastructure Take-Out Facility (TOF) concept. With BIC progressing to a new phase, all future issuances in relation to the TOF will now be undertaken by BIM. AIIB Vice President and Chief Investment Officer D.J. Pandian said: “AIIB’s investment in BIM is closely aligned with our objectives of developing Asian infrastructure as an asset class and supporting private capital mobilization. Through robust environmental, social and governance criteria, the platform provides institutional investors with a unique opportunity to support sustainable infrastructure projects in Asia. We are delighted to work with a highly experienced senior management team that has deep domain knowledge in infrastructure finance.” Clifford Capital Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Clive Kerner said: “This is an important milestone for Clifford Capital as we progress from the successful launch of the Infrastructure Takeout Facility with BIC to the establishment of BIM. We also welcome the participation of AIIB as a strategic partner in this landmark platform that addresses market gaps for infrastructure financing in Asia.” BIM CEO-designate Premod Thomas said: “Leveraging on the success of BIC, we are now committed to developing BIM as a long-term sustainable platform to encourage institutional investor participation in the fast-growing infrastructure funding needs in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. We look forward to working with AIIB and our bank partners as we leverage our platform to create sustainable investment products for institutional investors.” Monetary Authority of Singapore Executive Director and Head of Financial Markets Development Gillian Tan said: “Singapore has attracted a diverse mix of industry expertise and networks as part of its ambition to be a full-service Asia infrastructure financing hub. This first-of-its-kind platform demonstrates how infrastructure can be developed as a mainstream, investible asset class for mobilizing institutional capital.” BIM is expected to be capitalized at USD1.98 billion, comprising USD180 million in equity and USD1.8 billion in debt issuance capacity. AIIB will invest USD54 million, representing 30 percent of BIM’s equity capital, with the remaining USD126 million contributed by a new holding company to be established by Clifford Capital. The equity commitments from its shareholders and the proposed Government Guarantee are subject to the execution of final documentation. BIM is expected to be operational from the first quarter of 2020. Additional information about the project can be found here .

The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Low Carbon Energy Transition and Air Quality Improvement Project aims to increase the availability of natural gas to help reduce coal consumption and related emissions in the region surrounding China’s capital. \nWith a population of around 112.7 million 1 , the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is one of the most important economic engines within China. However, it has been facing the dual challenges of increasing energy demand and addressing air pollution, which directly affect the quality of life of local residents. China is endeavoring to control coal consumption as part of its commitments under the Paris Agreement to peak its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. Reducing coal consumption will also deliver the co-benefit of improving air quality. To meet its environmental commitments and still ensure adequate gas supply to maintain peoples’ livelihoods, an emergency reserve capacity is required. This became evident during a gas shortage which occurred in the winter of 2017/2018. \nThe project is AIIB’s first sovereign-backed financing in China. It involves the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Binhai District, Tianjin Municipality, covering LNG receiving, storage and regasification facilities and an unloading wharf.  AIIB financing will be used in the construction of LNG receiving, storage and regasification facilities. The project will be implemented by Beijing Gas Group Company Limited. \nUpon completion, the project will reduce coal consumption by approximately 11.9 million tons per year and help improve air quality by reducing a significant amount of coal combustion-related emissions such as CO 2 , SO 2 , NO x and particulate matters in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. \n“The project will support China’s efforts to fulfill its commitments under the Paris Agreement, and strengthen and contribute to the global response to the threat of climate change,” said AIIB Vice President and Chief Investment Officer D.J.

", "url": "https://www.aiib.org/en/news-events/news/2020/AIIB-Investing-to-Address-the-Digital-Divide-in-Asia.html", "detail": "With four billion people globally still unconnected, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is seeking to address the growing digital divide. In Asia only 26 per cent of the rural population has access to broadband and women are 10 percent less likely to own a mobile, with this gap growing to 28 per cent in South Asia. According to AIIB research, investing in digital infrastructure can increase the competitiveness of its members’ economies, improve the efficiency and sustainability of traditional infrastructure sectors through the adoption of new technologies, and attract more private capital investment to the sector. “So far, many countries have focused on gradually improving their traditional infrastructure for transport, communication and energy,” said AIIB Vice President for Policy and Strategy Joachim von Amsberg. “What is now needed is a shift to investing in tomorrow’s infrastructure. As a 21st century development bank, AIIB is well positioned to take on this challenge and support its members’ pursuit of their vision for an interconnected digital ecosystem. We hope this can serve as a basis for new business models that benefit a country’s citizens and boost sustainable development of the economy.” The International Telecommunications Union last year highlighted the positive knock-on effects improved digital infrastructure has on economic productivity, noting that in developing countries, a 10-percent increase in broadband coverage results in 1.4 percent of GDP growth. Meanwhile, McKinsey estimates that transforming operations and systems of infrastructure projects with digital technologies can reduce operating expenses by up to 25 percent, with performance gains of 20 to 40 percent in areas including safety, reliability, customer satisfaction, and regulatory compliance. Von Amsberg added that while the growth of the sector has mostly been financed by private capital, the rapid pace of development has outstripped current private investments. In parallel, there has also been a slowing down of multilateral development banks’ financing directed to information technology communications, with less than one percent of their resources directed towards it. “Because private-sector resources have fallen short of digital infrastructure needs, AIIB can leverage its balance sheet to provide significant resources with longer maturities and appropriate financing instruments,” he said. Given AIIB’s current knowledge and expertise, it is expected that the Bank will be in a position to invest in ‘hard’ digital infrastructure, like fibers, towers, data centers and other physical connectivity and data infrastructure from the start of the strategy. Investing in ‘soft’ digital infrastructure, like terminals, services and applications, will require a more gradual approach, with AIIB initially focusing its financing efforts on helping to make the adoption of technology and innovation become mainstream in traditional infrastructure sectors such as transport, energy, water and cities. This would provide a potential ‘supply-side’ solution to reducing the infrastructure financing gap and improving infrastructure quality. To help strengthen its key focus areas, AIIB is calling for public consultations on its draft Digital Infrastructure Strategy , which sets out the institution’s broad vision and strategic response to Asia’s rapidly evolving digital landscape.

The RMB3 billion issuance has a maturity of 3 years with a coupon rate of 2.40% and carries the Combating COVID-19 label approved by the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors. \nThe issuance received extraordinary support from both onshore and offshore investors (including through the Bond Connect Regime) resulting in a final book size of RMB 8.34 billion. The bonds were 2.78 times oversubscribed by more than 20 investors with 35% allocated to domestic and 65% to international investors. \nAIIB is the first Triple-A internationally rated issuer to have entered this market since the release in 2018 of the new panda bond guidelines governing international issuers. The bond is zero percent risk weighted in China, and was priced at 23bps lower than the valuation of China Development Bank Bonds as of close of business June 10, 2020. \n“The debut panda bond issuance represents an important milestone for AIIB as we enter the Chinese bond market for the first time,” said AIIB President and Chair of the Board Jin Liqun. “The issuance will raise important capital to facilitate AIIB’s response to COVID-19 in the short term and maintain its commitment to investing in sustainable infrastructure in the long term. As an international organization headquartered in Beijing, AIIB is also playing a role in the internationalization of China’s capital markets by providing both onshore and offshore investors with a very high quality RMB investment. This successful transaction serves as an important benchmark for our future issues in the years ahead.” \nAIIB Chief Financial Officer Andrew Cross said: “The successful pricing is another key milestone in AIIB’s funding strategy to be a diversified issuer with access to investors globally. The inaugural issuance highlights global investors’ recognition of the Bank’s high credit quality and commitment to sustainable infrastructure investments in the region and beyond.” \nThe net proceeds from the sale of the bonds will be included in the ordinary resources of AIIB.

The CRF was created as part of a coordinated international response to counter the COVID-19 pandemic and to respond flexibly and efficiently to client demands. It has an initial size of USD5-10 billion and is designed to support AIIB members’ urgent economic, financial and public health financing needs as well as to promote a quick recovery from the crisis. \nThrough end-2019, AIIB has funded two projects in China and, in April 2020, approved a third: an RMB2,485 million loan to upgrade the country’s sustainable public health infrastructure and provide emergency equipment and supplies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \nBank of China General Manager of the Investment Banking and Asset Management Department Hu Kun said: “AIIB is the first multilateral development bank (MDB) rated AAA by international credit rating agencies to access the panda bond market in recent years. The successful issuance demonstrates the depth of the CIBM market, while further enhancing the global investor base of AIIB. This bond issue sets the mark for other MDBs and prestigious global issuers to enter what is the second largest bond market in the world in terms of outstanding volume.” \nAIIB Treasurer Domenico Nardelli said: “The transaction demonstrates AIIB’s capital strength as well as commitment to strong governance and risk management. We are pleased to diversify our investor base by accessing Chinese onshore investors and providing them with the ability to diversify their high-quality liquid asset portfolios.” \nAIIB Head of Funding Martine Mills Hagen said: “The funding team has been dedicated to attaining our panda registration since the end of last year. The pricing achieved is reflective of our very strong credit fundamentals and Triple A ratings from S&P Global Ratings, Moody’s Investor Services and Fitch Ratings. The bond proceeds will be included in AIIB’s ordinary resources, which are used to finance AIIB’s CRF.” \nAt the end of May 2020, AIIB mandated Bank of China Limited as Lead Underwriter and Bookrunner.

This is especially the case among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which employ approximately 74 percent of the country’s workforce. Companies are facing revenue and job losses as well as funding difficulties. The crisis is also expected to aggravate financial institutions’ funding and liquidity vulnerabilities, leaving financing gaps to address the liquidity constraints among businesses. \nThe Turkey COVID-19 Credit Line Project , funded by AIIB’s COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility (CRF), provides sovereign-backed short-term credit lines to Türkiye Kalkınma ve Yatırım Bankası (TKYB) and Türkiye Sınai Kalkınma Bankası (TSKB). The two borrowers will on-lend the loans to corporates and SMEs in infrastructure sectors, including transport, energy, water, sustainable cities, healthcare, information and communications technologies and other eligible productive sectors. The credit lines will provide liquidity for payment of operating expenses, short-term assets (inventories, trade receivables, etc.) and liabilities. \n“By supporting Turkey’s efforts to supply working capital to the real economy, the project will help increase access to vital liquidity and mitigate distress and supply chain disruptions at this challenging time,” said AIIB Vice President, Investment Operations, Konstantin Limitovskiy. “The financing will improve the resilience of small and medium companies which are the foundation of the Turkish economy and crucial for economic recovery and long-term sustainable development.” \nTKYB General Manager İbrahim Öztop said: “We would like to thank AIIB for its support at this time of uncertainty and also for its trust in TKYB, which we highly appreciate. We believe that the additional resources secured by our Bank from development finance institutions like AIIB will contribute towards Turkey’s domestic efforts to support the country’s production potential and offset the negative effects the COVID-19 outbreak is having on economic activity and employment. This credit line will be extended both to large and small enterprises but will particularly benefit SMEs, which are the backbone of our economy and currently suffer from revenue losses and financial difficulties due to the pandemic.” \nTSKB Acting CEO Ms Ece Börü said: “TSKB has been serving under all circumstances for 70 years in order to ensure our country attains its goals in its sustainable development journey. The pandemic has inflicted its effects on our economy, as it has done all over the world. The loan package approved by AIIB is going to make a significant contribution to allowing development banking to create solutions for short-term problems so as not to miss long term targets while increasing resilience. Furthermore, we welcome the exciting opportunity to use this loan facility as a means to intensify our existing cooperation with AIIB in the fields of renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure investments, which has continued since 2018. Inspired by this new loan agreement, we will continue to contribute to the sustainable economic development of our country while supporting the labor force and production supply chain.” \nThe two short-term loans comprise (1) USD300 million to TKYB covering direct on-lending and Apex on-lending to SME sub-borrowers through partner financial institutions and (2) USD200 million to TSKB covering direct on-lending. \nBoth TKYB and TSKB are existing AIIB clients. Previous projects are TKYB Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency On-Lending Facility (2019) and TSKB Sustainable Energy and Infrastructure On-lending Facility (2018) . TKYB is a state-owned development bank established in 1975 offering long-term finance for sustainable development and investment banking activities. TSKB is a private development and investment bank in Turkey established in 1950 offering corporate lending, project finance, investment banking and advisory services to support the country's sustainable development. \nThe CRF, created as part of the coordinated international response to counter the COVID-19 crisis, has an initial size of USD5-10 billion to support AIIB members’ urgent economic, financial and public health financing needs. As of end-June 2020, AIIB has approved a total of 13 projects amounting to over USD5.5 billion to support 11 members to navigate the challenges caused by these highly uncertain times.

This benchmark investor tool will for the first time holistically assess climate change risks and opportunities in line with the three objectives of the Paris Agreement at the issuer-level. \nEndorsed by Climate Bonds Initiative, a major international certifier and industry thought leader in the green and climate bond market, the AIIB-Amundi Climate Change Investment Framework translates the three key objectives of the Paris Agreement into fundamental metrics, equipping investors with a new tool to assess an issuer’s level of alignment with climate change mitigation, adaptation and low-carbon transition objectives. \nWhile groups of leading institutional investors have responded to the climate challenge by integrating climate change into investment processes, the Framework developed by AIIB and Amundi takes a holistic approach that current private-capital mobilization efforts lack. Equity capital markets  currently  focus on thematic funds  and commonly face strong sector bias, while low-carbon indexes have a pronounced focus on mitigation efforts. In fixed income, green bonds have been the main climate finance solution for debt capital markets, but they do not consider exposure to climate investment risks and opportunities from the viewpoint of an issuer’s entire balance sheet. \n“The global climate challenge is a huge threat to our world and urgent multilateral action is needed to address this crisis and help our members meet their commitments to the Paris Agreement,” said AIIB President and Chair of the Board of Directors Jin Liqun at the Climate Bonds Initiative international conference. “In launching this Framework today, we and our partners show our commitment to playing an important role in the battle against climate change, by contributing to strengthening market capacity and driving the green agenda in Asia.” \nInvestors can expect portfolios aligned with this Framework to deliver a potential financial impact by benefiting from any future repricing of climate change risks and opportunities in the capital market. The Framework allows investors to measure issuer performance against the three objectives of the Paris Agreement. This allows investors to systematically include A-list issuers (those that are already performing well on all three objectives) and B-list issuers (those that are moving in the right direction but are not A-list issuers yet) into their investment portfolio. An investment strategy targeting both A and B List issuers should be more resilient to climate change risk and more exposed to opportunities not yet priced in by the market. \nIn addition, the Framework also delivers extra financial impact as it is designed to encourage the integration of climate change risks and opportunities into business practices by targeting the engagement of so-called “B-List” issuers to help them transition to “A-List” credentials. \nYves Perrier, CEO of Amundi, added: “We are proud to launch this Framework with AIIB as we continue to make strides in the field of climate finance. Mobilizing key stakeholders in supporting the Paris Agreement in Asia is in line with Amundi’s commitment to ESG investing and reflects our extensive commitment to the region. This new Framework will further help the investment community address climate change through the mobilization of capital to emerging markets where it is much needed.” \nSean Kidney, CEO, Climate Bonds Initiative, commented: “Action on climate means action on investment and private sector involvement to create green capital markets. With this Framework, AIIB and Amundi are laying a new foundation for the development and growth of climate finance and transition investment in the region.” \nThis Framework builds upon AIIB’s climate finance milestones to date. In 2019 AIIB’s climate finance amounted to USD1.7 billion or 39 percent of total financing approved—an increase from USD2.5 billion or 35 percent of total financing approved over the previous three years combined (2016-2018). In 2019 the Bank launched the USD500 million AIIB Asia Climate Bond Portfolio to accelerate members’ climate action, catalyze  emerging market investment and address the underdeveloped climate-aligned bond market, providing a working model for the Framework. The portfolio will also function as the investment case for the Framework. \nAmundi has been at the forefront of Climate Finance development, creating innovative solutions to bring new large-scale funding dedicated to financing the low-carbon economy across asset classes and geographies. As a responsible investor, Amundi seeks to fulfil its role by supporting investor mobilization and market development through flagship initiatives (such as the Portfolio Decarbonization Coalition) and partnerships with multilateral finance institutions. As of June 2020, climate finance solutions represented EUR19 billion in assets under management. \n-ENDS- \nFor more information about the AIIB-Amundi Climate Change Investment Framework visit: https://www.aiib.org/en/policies-strategies/framework-agreements/climate-change-investment-framework/index.html \nAbout AIIB \nThe Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is a multilateral development bank with a mission to improve social and economic outcomes in Asia.

The five-year sustainable development bond raised GBP 800 million and will finance AIIB’s mission of financing infrastructure for tomorrow – investing in sustainable infrastructure to unlock new capital, new technologies and new ways in which to address climate change and to connect Asia, and the world. The pricing of this bond is the latest milestone for AIIB.  Despite being AIIB’s first outing in the GBP market, and its fifth-ever syndicated benchmark transaction in the international capital markets, the deal was met with wide ranging demand. The orderbook closed in excess of GBP 2.0 billion from 74 orders with strong support from Bank Treasuries, Official Institutions and wider real money investors. \nAIIB Chief Financial Officer Andrew Cross hailed the issuance of this first Sterling denominated sustainable development bond benchmark as another landmark transaction for the Bank. He said: “We are still in the establishment phase of our borrowing program and therefore every new market is approached strategically and involves very significant investor work to ensure a successful transaction.” \nAIIB Treasurer Domenico Nardelli said: “This marks another step towards building a diversified funding program. With a borrowing program of USD 9 billion for this year and an increasing borrowing requirement going forward, it is essential to establish ourselves in as many markets as possible such that we have a diversified source of funds for the years to come.” \nAIIB Head of Funding Martine Mills Hagen said: “It was gratifying to see all of the investor work really paying off with so many new investors coming into the book. We were 1.5 times oversubscribed but were limited in terms of deal size by the size of the Borrowing Authority for 2020.

Eighty percent of its total land area is distributed among 1,200 coral islands, of which only 188 are inhabited, many are remote, and nearly all are physically vulnerable to rising sea levels. \nThe Maldives created the artificial island of Thilafushi some 30 years ago to serve as a dumpsite for the waste generated in the Greater Malé capital region. As the Maldives’ economy is based mainly on tourism and fisheries, both of which rely heavily on a pristine environment, a more sustainable solution to the garbage problem had to be found. \nIn response, the Government of Maldives, with support from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and other multilateral development banks, is putting up a sustainable regional solid waste treatment system in the Greater Malé region. It has the goal of ensuring the safe disposal or recycling of waste, reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of the island state, and generating electricity from waste-to-energy. The facility is intended to handle 500 tons of waste per day and convert it to electricity, which is eventually expected to generate eight megawatts (MW) of surplus electricity by the end of 2024. \nAIIB has approved a USD40-million loan for the Greater Malé Waste-to-Energy Project , which is being co-financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Japan Fund for the Joint Crediting Mechanism. \n“The Greater Malé Waste-to-Energy project will benefit the people in the Greater Malé region, as well as have a wider global impact by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the impacts of climate change. AIIB welcomes the opportunity to partner with the Government of Maldives and other partners to create a more sustainable waste management system,” said AIIB Vice President, Investment Operations, D.J. Pandian. \nThis is the second AIIB loan to the Maldives, the first being a loan under AIIB’s COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility to help the country with its Emergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness Project against COVID-19 . \nBecause the country is at great risk of rising sea levels due to climate change, as well as natural disasters like tsunamis and extreme climate events, the project design incorporates disaster-and climate-resilient features such as raised floor elevations, and flood-proof mechanical and electrical equipment. The cost estimates and implementation schedule also accommodate possible delays or cost increases due to the impact of COVID-19 on supply chains. \nThe project includes a capacity building component to help government officials manage the project and conduct environmental monitoring. In addition, targeted public awareness campaigns in the main population centers of Malé, Hulhumale, and Villimale will be provided to raise awareness of the new waste collection and waste management system, and 3R (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle) behaviors to support a clean environment. \nAbout AIIB \nThe Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is a multilateral development bank with a mission to improve social and economic outcomes in Asia.
