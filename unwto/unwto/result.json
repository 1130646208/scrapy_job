But even as growing numbers of tourists cross borders and businesses open up again, this is \nno time for complacency\n . \nJust as we stressed at the beginning of this crisis: words of support are not enough for tourism to recover. Concrete actions are needed. \nFor UNWTO, this means supporting Member States and the wider tourism sector as it adapts and transitions towards a more resilient and sustainable future. \nThe visit of a \nUNWTO delegation to the Canary Islands\n allowed us to do just this. \nThrough inviting members of the media, private sector leaders and political leaders to join us for this official visit, UNWTO was able to show that \ntourism’s return can be managed safely and responsibly\n. It is possible to prioritise health while at the same time safeguarding jobs and promoting economic recovery! \nAt the same time, the innovation running through our sector means that the restart of tourism can help get the global community back on track as we work together to fulfil the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \nThe \nUNWTO Sustainable Development Goals Startup Competition\n, which was launched this week, will identify new ideas with the power and potential to reimagine tourism and enhance the sector’s \npositive impact on people and planet\n. I urge all entrepreneurs and innovators to step up and take part. Only through embracing the new can we emerge from this crisis stronger, more resilient and better prepared for the challenges that lie ahead, including addressing inequality and climate action. \nAs we look to the future, however, we must also pause to reflect on the \nterrible human cost of the pandemic\n. This week, I was honoured to join His Majesty King Felipe VI, alongside the Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and guests including the Director-General of the World Health Organization Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, and Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary-General of NATO, as well as other national and international political leaders at a special event to commemorate all those who have lost their lives to COVID-19 in Spain. \nThe presence of such high-level figures from within and also from outside of Spain was testament to the \ninternational solidarity\n that has characterised our response to this pandemic. It also represented an opportunity for us all to express our appreciation to the health workers who worked – and continue to work – on the frontline of this public health emergency. \nThroughout this crisis, our host country has shown great \nresolve\n. It now carries that spirit into a determination to grow back and recover. \nUNWTO offers our full support to Spain, as we do to every other Member State, and will continue to work closely with the government to ensure tourism fulfils its unique potential as a tool for economic recovery and social cohesion.\nZurab Pololikashvili\n\rSecretary-General,\n\rWorld Tourism Organization\n"},

The \nresponsible restart\n of the sector will allow the many benefits tourism offers to return, and UNWTO welcomes the measures that have been taken to build confidence and trust in the sector.”\n                      Tourism is one of the most important economic sectors for the Canary Islands, providing jobs and livelihoods and supporting many local businesses                  \nThis official visit follows a successful visit to Italy – the first trip undertaken since restrictions on international travel were eased within the Schengen Zone of Europe. Both visits recognize how tourism is a lifeline for many countries and highlights support for tourism at every political levels and the close collaboration with the private sector.\nThe UNWTO Regional Director for Europe, Alessandra Priante, said: “Health and safety, including the state of healthcare systems, are now key elements for all destinations. This needs to be reflected in their marketing and communications strategies, both now as tourism restarts and into the future as the sector recovers. Tourism has proven its resilience and its unique ability to drive the recovery and development of societies and it will do so again, and this time sustainability and innovation must be front and centre.”\nAlongside meetings with public sector leaders, the UNWTO delegation also saw first-hand the steps being taken by the private sector to ensure the highest level of public safety and hygiene in tourism destinations.\nIn parallel, UNWTO officials visited each of the eight islands of the Canarian Archipelago to see first-hand the safety protocols put in place to \nmaximize security and safety\n. A group of up to 60 Spanish and international media also witnessed the safety updates along the whole tourism value chain.\n"},

These recommendations addressing hygiene and disposable plastic can support tourism sector stakeholders in their efforts towards a responsible recovery.\nThe recommendations come as major global tourism companies Accor, Club Med, and Iberostar Group cement their commitment to fighting plastic pollution and become three of \nthe first official signatories to the Global Tourism Plastics Initiative\n, along with more than 20 signatories from across all continents, including major industry players and supporting organisations which will act as multipliers.

The brief stresses that tourism is an essential pillar of the SDGs and the most vulnerable workers and nations are at greatest risk.\nTourism has been among the hardest hit of all sectors by COVID-19 and \nno country has been unaffected\n, with restrictions on travel and a sudden drop in consumer demand leading to an unprecedented fall in international tourist numbers.\nThe “COVID-19 and Transforming Tourism” Policy Brief from the \nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres\n, makes clear the impact that the pandemic has had on global tourism and how this affects everything from jobs and economies to wildlife conservation and the protection of cultural heritage.\nMr Guterres said: that “It is imperative that we \nrebuild the tourism sector\n” in a “safe, equitable and climate friendly” manner and so “ensure tourism regains its position as a provider of decent jobs, stable incomes and the protection of our cultural and natural heritage”. The UN Secretary-General further underscored that tourism is \none of the world’s most important economic sectors\n, providing “livelihoods to hundreds of millions more”, while it “boosts economies and enables countries to thrive”, and at the same time allowing “people to experience some of the world’s cultural and natural riches and brings people closer to each other, highlighting our common humanity”.\n                      It is imperative that we rebuild the tourism sector ensure tourism regains its position as a provider of decent jobs, stable incomes and the protection of our cultural and natural heritage                  \nThe Brief warns that the impacts of the pandemic on tourism are \nalready placing conservation efforts in jeopardy\n. Citing case studies from around the world, it warns that the sudden fall in tourism revenues has cut off funding for \nbiodiversity conservation\n and, with livelihoods at risk in and around protected areas, cases of poaching and looting are expected to rise. Again, the impact on biodiversity and ecosystems will be particularly critical in SIDS and LDCs. Furthermore, with \n90% of World Heritages Sites having closed\n as a result of the pandemic, both tangible and intangible heritage is at risk in all parts of the world.\nUNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “Tourism touches on nearly every part of our societies and is a cornerstone of growth and employment, both in developed and developing economies. The United Nations Secretary-General echoes the five key priority areas that UNWTO has identified for tourism to return and drive wider recovery, and both governments and the private sector now have a duty to put this plan into action.”\nThe Policy Brief notes that \nwomen, youth\n and \nworkers in the informal economy\n are most at risk from job losses and business closures across the tourism sector. At the same time, destinations most reliant on tourism for jobs and economic growth, including \nSIDS\n) and Least Developed Countries (\nLDCs\n) are\n likely to be hardest\n hit, including through an anticipated fall in foreign direct investment (FDI).\nIn addition to calling for strong support for the sector in mitigating these massive impacts, the Brief stresses that \nthis crisis represents an opportunity to rethink tourism\n, including how it contributes to the SDGs. To this end, the Policy Brief provides \nFive Priorities for the restart of tourism\n, all aimed at ensuring a more resilient, inclusive and carbon neutral sector. These priorities are:\nAlongside penholder UNWTO, a further 11 United Nations agencies contributed to the Policy Brief, highlighting the sector’s unique importance and outreach.\n"},

This latest outlook, recorded on 19 July, is \nup from 22% of destinations\n that had eased restrictions on travel by 15 June and the 3% previously observed by 15 May. It confirms the \ntrend of a slow but continuous adaptation and responsible restart\n of international tourism.\nAt the same time, however, of the 87 destinations that have now eased travel restrictions, \njust four have completely lifted all restrictions\n, while 83 have eased them while keeping some measures such as the partial closure of borders in place.

As destinations continue to ease restrictions on travel, international cooperation is of paramount importance. This way, global tourism can gain people’s trust and confidence, essential foundations as we work together to adapt to the new reality we now face.”\nAccording to the UNWTO report, destinations with a higher dependency on tourism are more likely to be easing restrictions on travel: Of the 87 destinations that have eased restrictions recently, 20 are Small Island Developing States (SIDS), many of which depend on tourism as a central pillar of employment, economic growth and  development. The report also shows that around half (41) of all those destinations that have eased restrictions are in Europe, confirming the leading role of the region for the responsible restart of tourism.\nMany destinations still in long-term lockdown\nLooking at the 115 destinations that continue to have their borders completely closed to international tourism, the report finds that a majority (88) have been completely closed their borders for international tourism for \nmore than 12 weeks\n.\nThe cost related to the travel restrictions introduced in response to COVID-19 has historic dimensions. This week, UNWTO released the data on the impact of the pandemic on tourism, both in terms of lost tourist arrivals and lost revenues. The data shows that by already by the end of May, the pandemic had led to \nUS$320 billion in lost revenues\n, already three times the cost of the 2009 Global Economic Crisis.\n"},

The dramatic fall in international tourism places many millions of livelihoods at risk, including in developing countries. Governments in every world region have a dual responsibility: to prioritize public health while also protecting jobs and businesses.

Most members of the UNWTO Panel of Tourism Experts expect international tourism to recover by the second half of 2021, followed by those who expect a rebound in the first part of next year. \nThe group of global experts points to a series of downside risks such as travel restrictions and border shutdowns still in place in most destinations, major outbound markets such as the United States and China being at standstill, safety concerns associated with travel, \nthe resurgence of the virus and risks of new lockdowns\n or curfews. Furthermore, concerns over a lack of reliable information and a deteriorating economic environment are indicated as factors weighing on consumer confidence.\n"},

For this to happen, even greater collaboration between the public and private sectors is needed. This enhanced partnership with the World Tourism Organization will help guide aviation’s recovery over the critical months ahead.”\nIATA has been an Affiliate Member of UNWTO since 1978, providing a strong voice for the international air transport sector. IATA is also an active member of the Board of the UNWTO’s Affiliate Members and contributed to the UNWTO Global Guidelines to Restart Tourism, released in May to help guide governments and the private sector in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This collaboration was reflected in the final publication. A set distinct set of recommendations for the air transport sector were included, with a focus on the introduction of enhanced hygiene protocols to guarantee the safety of both passengers and airline workers. The Global Guidelines also emphasized the need for strong partnership and coordination at every level of the airline sector.\nThis latest partnership comes as UNWTO continues to lead the global tourism sector in its response to the challenges posed by the pandemic. As well as close cooperation with private sector associations and businesses, UNWTO also recently signed an agreement with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), that will see the two UN agencies work together to harness the power of tourism to drive the sustainable social and economic development of rural communities.\n"},

Instead, \nnations from the MERCOSUR Member States \n(Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, with Chile joining as Member Associate status) will serve as \njoint hosts.\n This co-hosting agreement exemplifies the \nspirit of international solidarity\n that runs through tourism and which UNWTO has recognized as essential for recovery.\nUNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “All around the world, tourism empowers rural communities, providing jobs and opportunity, most notably for women and youth. Tourism also enables rural communities to hold onto their unique cultural heritage and traditions, and the sector is vital for safeguarding habitat and endangered species. This World Tourism Day is a chance to recognize the role tourism plays outside of major cities and its ability to build a better future for all.”\nFor countless rural communities around the world, tourism is a leading provider of employment and opportunities. In many places, \nit is one of the few viable economic sectors\n. Moreover, development through tourism can also keep rural communities alive. It is estimated that by 2050, 68% of the world population will live in urban areas, while 80% of those currently living in ‘extreme poverty’ live outside of towns and cities.\nThe situation is particularly hard for youth: young people in rural communities are three times more likely to be unemployed than older adults. \nTourism is a lifeline\n, offering young people a chance to earn a living without having to migrate either within their home countries or abroad.\nWorld Tourism Day 2020 will once again be celebrated by UNWTO’s Member States in all global regions as well as by cities and other destinations and by private sector organizations and individual tourists. It comes as communities in rural areas also struggle with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. These communities are usually much less-prepared to deal with the short and longer-term impacts of the crisis. This is due to a number of factors, including their aging populations, lower income levels and the continuing ‘digital divide’. Tourism offers a solution to all of these challenges.  \n"},

Though many remain cautious in view of the development of the pandemic, the seventh edition of the UNWTO “COVID-19 Related Travel Restrictions: A Global Review for Tourism” confirms the ongoing trend towards the gradual restart of tourism.             \nAnalysing restrictions up to 1 September, the research carried out by the United Nations specialized agency for tourism found that a total of \n115 destinations\n (53% of all destinations worldwide) have \neased travel restrictions\n, an increase of 28 since 19 July. Of these, two have lifted all restrictions, while the remaining 113 continue to have certain restrictive measures in place.\nUNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “Coordinated leadership and enhanced cooperation between governments means tourism is slowly but steadily restarting in many parts of the world. Starting to ease restrictions on travel opens also the doors for tourism’s social and economic benefits to return. While we  must remain vigilant and cautious, we are concerned about those destinations with ongoing full travel restrictions, especially where tourism is a lifeline and economic and social development are under threat.”\n                      Coordinated leadership and enhanced cooperation between governments means tourism is slowly but steadily restarting in many parts of the world                  \nFor the first time, the COVID-19 Related Travel Restrictions report \nincludes key data on the health and hygiene infrastructure\n in place at destinations, while also analysing rate of notifications of new COVID-19 cases. This allows UNWTO to determine the factors that are influencing destinations’ decisions to ease restrictions. Notably, the report shows:\nAt the same time, the report shows that many destinations around the world are extremely cautious about easing travel restrictions they introduced in response to the pandemic and some have passed severe measures in an attempt to keep their citizens safe. 93 destinations (43% of all worldwide destinations) continue to have their \nborders completely closed to tourism, \nof which 27 have had their borders completely closed for at least 30 weeks.\nFurthermore, more than \nhalf of all destinations with borders completely closed\n to tourism are classified as being among the \nWorld’s Most Vulnerable Countries\n. They include 10 SIDS (Small Island Developing States), one Least Developed Country (LDC) and three Land-Locked Developing Countries (LLDCs). More than half of destinations with full restrictions still in place are also highly dependent on aviation, with at least 70% of their tourist arrivals coming by air, causing significant connectivity impacts for their citizens and economies.  \nUNWTO continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the tourism. From the start, the UN specialized agency has advised that the \nsituation is fluid\n and that, even as tourism restarts in some regions, in others, restrictions may be tightened and borders re-closed. Similarly, UNWTO has observed a rise in travel advisories being issued by governments for their own citizens, alongside more and varied restrictions and other measures directed at passengers arriving from specific countries or regions.\n"},

According to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), with domestic tourism set to return faster than international travel, this represents an opportunity for both developed and developing countries to recover from the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.             \nRecognizing the importance of domestic tourism, the United Nations specialized agency has released the third of its Tourism and COVID-19 Briefing Notes, -Understanding Domestic Tourism and Seizing its Opportunities.- UNWTO data shows that in 2018, \naround 9 billion domestic tourism trips were made\n worldwide – six times the number of international tourist arrivals (1.4 billion in 2018). The publication identifies ways in which destinations around the world are taking \nproactive steps to grow domestic tourism\n, from offering bonus holidays for workers to providing vouchers and other incentives to people travelling in their own countries.\nUNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “UNWTO expects domestic tourism to return faster and stronger than international travel.

In \nOECD nations, \ndomestic tourism accounts for 75% of total tourism expenditure\n, while in the European Union, domestic tourism expenditure is 1.8 times higher than inbound tourism expenditure. Globally, the largest domestic tourism markets in terms of expenditure are the United States with nearly US$ 1 trillion, Germany with US$ 249 billion, Japan US$ 201 billion, the United Kingdom with US$ 154 billion and Mexico with US$ 139 billion.\nGiven the value of domestic tourism and current trends, increasing numbers of countries are taking steps to grow their markets, UNWTO reports. This new Briefing Note provides case studies of initiatives designed to stimulate domestic demand. These include initiatives focused on \nmarketing and promotion\n as well as \nfinancial incentives\n. Examples of countries taking targeted steps to boost domestic tourist numbers include:\n"},

According to the new issue of the World Tourism Barometer from the United Nations specialized agency, international tourist arrivals dropped by 65% during the first half of the year. This represents an unprecedented decrease, as countries around the world closed their borders and introduced travel restrictions in response to the pandemic.             \nOver recent weeks, a growing number of destinations have started to open up again to international tourists. UNWTO reports that, as of early September, \n53% of destinations had eased travel restrictions\n. Nevertheless, many governments remain cautious, and this latest report shows that the lockdowns introduced during the first half of the year have had a massive impact on international tourism. The sharp and sudden fall in arrivals has placed millions of jobs and businesses at risk.\nAccording to UNWTO, the massive drop in international travel demand over the period January-June 2020 translates into a loss of \n440 million international arrivals\n and about \nUS$ 460 billion\n in export revenues from international tourism. This is around five times the loss in international tourism receipts recorded in 2009 amid the global economic and financial crisis.\n                      Safe and responsible international travel is now possible in many parts of the world, and it is imperative that governments work closely with the private sector to get global tourism moving again                  \nUNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “The latest World Tourism Barometer shows the deep impact this pandemic is having on tourism, a sector upon which millions of people depend for their livelihoods. However, safe and responsible international travel is now possible in many parts of the world, and it is imperative that governments work closely with the private sector to get global tourism moving again. Coordinated action is key.”\nDespite the gradual reopening of many destinations since the second half of May, the anticipated improvement in international tourism numbers during the peak summer season in the Northern Hemisphere did not materialize. Europe was the second-hardest hit of all global regions, with a 66% decline in tourist arrivals in the first half of 2020. The Americas (-55%), Africa and the Middle East (both -57%) also suffered. However, Asia and the Pacific, the first region to feel the impact of COVID-19 on tourism, was the hardest hit, with a 72% fall in tourists for the six-month period.\nAt the sub-regional level, North-East Asia (-83%) and Southern Mediterranean Europe (-72%) suffered the largest declines. All world regions and sub-regions recorded \ndeclines of more than 50% in arrivals\n in January-June 2020. The contraction of international demand is also reflected in double-digit declines in international tourism expenditure among large markets. Major outbound markets such as the United States and China continue to be at a standstill, though some markets such as France and Germany have shown some improvement in June. \nLooking ahead, it seems likely that reduced travel demand and consumer confidence will continue to impact results for the rest of the year. In May, UNWTO outlined three possible scenarios, pointing to declines of 58% to 78% in international tourist arrivals in 2020. Current trends through August point to a drop in demand closer to 70% (Scenario 2), especially now as some destinations re-introduce restrictions on travel.\nThe extension of the scenarios to 2021 point to a change in trend next year, based on the assumptions of a gradual and linear lifting of travel restrictions, the availability of a vaccine or treatment and a return of traveller confidence. Nonetheless, despite this, the return to 2019 levels in terms of tourist arrivals would take between \n2½\n to 4 years.\n"},

He further stressed that “this Executive Council is an important platform for collaboration, to explore the way forward and to support the future of tourism”.\nThe Members of the Council warmly welcomed the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's offer to establish and host a \nUNWTO Regional Office for the Middle East\n. As the Kingdom works to increase tourist arrivals, including through the relaxation of visa rules for visitors, the new office will provide UNWTO with a base from which to guide tourism's development across the whole region.\nHis Excellency Ahmed Al Khateeb, Minister of Tourism for the Kingdom, commended UNWTO for “its leadership during this challenging period. We are honoured that Saudi Arabia has been approved as the location for the UNWTO Regional Office for the Middle East. This collaborative approach will help drive growth and build resilience across the tourism sector at national and regional levels.” He announced that the Regional Office for the Middle East will be opened between the end of 2020 and 2021.\nThe Executive Council agreed to the ‘\nTbilisi Declaration: Actions for Sustainable Recovery\n’\n.

The Under-Secretary of Tourism for Chile, José Luis Uriarte, similarly pledged to use tourism to “support rural communities suffering from the economic and social repercussions of this pandemic.”\nTaking part in the round-table discussion that followed were Mario Alberto González Sanchez, Director of Mexican Secretariat of Tourism, and the Chilean chef and UNWTO Special Ambassador, Pilar Rodriguez. Joining them were Lisandro Menu-Marque, Director at Globalia, and Shannon Stowell, CEO of the Professional Adventure Travel Association and the Adventure Travel Fund of the USA.\nUNWTO used the occasion of World Tourism Day to launch its new \nRecommendations on Tourism and Rural Development\n. The new publication outlines the key steps destinations can take to fully harness the potential of tourism to help drive social and economic recovery outside of urban areas.\nRecognising the important role new ideas and technology will play in this, UNWTO also announced the winners of its Rural Tourism Innovation Competition. Organized with the Government of Spain, Google Spain and the Federation of Rural Women’s Associations (FADEMUR). The competition attracted more than 130 applications from across Spain. Almost half of applications (43%) were put forward by women.\n My Street Book\n won the prize in the Innovation category, and the winner of the prize for the start-up with the biggest social impact was \nVan Woow\n.\n"},

This new MoU comes on the back of World Tourism Day 2020, which was celebrated worldwide around the special theme of \nTourism and Rural Development\n. Under the agreement, UNWTO and FAO will build a framework for enhanced collaboration, including through the sharing of knowledge and resources.\nUNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “This Memorandum of Understanding between UNWTO and the FAO emphasises the cross-cutting nature of tourism and the importance of cooperation at every level to ensure the sector works for everyone. Both tourism and agriculture are lifelines for communities around the world. The agreement is particularly timely as it comes as we recognize 2020 as the year of Tourism for Rural Development.

Across the FAO’s GIAHS (Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems) network of communities, tourism is a leading driver of equality, with the sector \nemploying women and youth\n and giving them a stake in economic growth. Tourism is also a protector of the \nrich cultural heritage\n that characterizes many of the communities within the GIAHS network, for instance through keeping folklore and other traditions alive for future generations.\nMoving forward, the new MoU states that UNWTO and FAO will work together to establish a plan for more specific areas of collaboration. Key priorities, as outlined in the agreement, include encouraging entrepreneurship within rural communities, particularly among youth and women, with the aim of providing them with access to both local and global markets for their products. Other priorities include fostering education and skills so as to provide communities with opportunities within the tourism sector.\n"},

As a sector, tourism is a leading global employer and, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO), more than half of all workers in the accommodation and food services sector in most SIDS reporting data are women.

As leaders in \ngastronomy and fashion\n, they represent two of Italy’s biggest economic sectors and two of the industries that contribute to making the country a global tourism leader. Since launching his own company in 1975, Giorgio Armani has become synonymous with Italian style. As a chef, Gino Sorbillo celebrates traditional Nepalese pizza and has opened award-winning restaurants around the world. \nUNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “Italy is one of the world’s most famous tourist destinations. Each year, millions of people visit to enjoy its culture, its fashion and its gastronomy. In return, tourism supports livelihoods and local and regional economies and helps preserve this Italian culture. As UNWTO Special Ambassador for Tourism, Giorgio Armani can help amplify UNWTO’s key messages of the power of tourism to create opportunities and drive growth. As UNWTO Special Ambassador for Gastronomy Tourism, Gino Sorbillo will showcase the unique ability of gastronomy to preserve and promote heritage and give tourists a unique taste of the destinations they visit.”\nUpon receiving the plaque, Mr Armani said: ‘I am genuinely pleased to have been honoured in this way by an organisation that believes that people should be encouraged to see the beauty of the globe in a respectful and responsible manner. It has been a sense of responsibility for our community that has helped my country through this terrible pandemic, and this too is what has driven me to play my small part in helping those engaged in the fight against the virus, and the fight against the economic challenges it has posed. A belief in community – the global community – and an appreciation of the humanity we all share are what will help us build a better future for ourselves and the generations to come, through being mindful of the important things in life, like the preciousness of the environment and our duty to protect it. It is therefore an honour to take up the role of Special Ambassador for Tourism.’\nThe appointments also strengthen UNWTO’s strong relationship with Italy, the first Member State to receive a visit from the organization’s leadership since destinations around the world introduced restrictions on travel in response to the pandemic. The UNWTO delegation led by the Secretary-General will visit Rome, Italy, Milan and Venice and work with both the national and city authorities to support tourism’s restart and ensure this goes hand-in-hand with wider economic and social recovery.\n"},

Globally, tourism generates directly or indirectly one in every ten jobs. The COVID-19 crisis has devastated the tourism economy, with unprecedented effects on jobs and businesses. Tourism was one of the first sectors to be deeply affected by the COVID-19 containment measures, and with the ongoing travel restrictions and the looming global recession, it also risks being among one of the last to recover. Strong and coordinated action is required to save millions of livelihoods.\nWith a 60-80% decline in international tourism foreseen for 2020, and a drop of between US $910 billion and $1.2 trillion in exports, today over 100 million direct tourism jobs are at risk. Apart from this direct impact, the tourism economy is also linked to many other sectors including construction, agro-food, distribution services and transportation, all of which exacerbate the size of the shock. COVID-19 has revealed the macroeconomic importance of tourism in most OECD and G20 economies. Many businesses across the sector are fighting to survive, with a disproportionate effect on women, young people, rural communities, indigenous peoples and informal workers – groups that are more likely to be employed in micro or small tourism businesses. This crisis is also creating an even greater hardship for low-income and developing economies, and their local communities, which disproportionately depend on tourism and hence face a serious risk of higher poverty.\nThe current crisis has also exposed gaps in government and industry preparedness and response capacity. Policy action at national and international levels, as well as heightened coordination, are urgently needed across sectors and borders to restore traveller and business confidence, stimulate demand and accelerate tourism recovery. \nThis crisis is an opportunity to rethink tourism development. The recovery must involve transforming the sector, re-inventing tourism destinations and businesses, re-building the tourism ecosystem, and innovating and investing in sustainable tourism.\nAt its heart, tourism is about experiences, including the tastes of local food, the exploration of local landscapes, and the sights of historical significance. But it is mostly about people – be they local guides, accommodation operators or other service providers who make your journey special or help you to do business and reach international markets. As such, our collective response must put people first and live up to the pledge of leaving nobody behind. This crisis should be an opportunity to ensure a fairer distribution of tourism’s benefits and advance the transition towards a carbon-neutral and more resilient tourism economy.\nOn the eve of the G20 Tourism Ministers meeting this 7 October under the Saudi Presidency, as the leaders of the OECD and UNWTO, we call for strong and urgent action across three fronts to sustain millions of livelihoods.\nFirst, \nstrengthened multilateral co-operation and robust support are critical to reactivate travel. \nCollaboration and consistency of travel regulations at bilateral, regional and international levels are the stepping-stones that will allow tourism to restart safely, accelerate economic recovery and provide hope for millions of people. This includes strengthening safety and security for travellers and workers and facilitating safe cross border travel, as well as building more resilient destinations. It is vital to reinforce global co-operation and aid to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on travel and tourism and to help accelerate both the economic and social recovery. Getting the tourism ecosystem back up and running will require a coordinated and integrated approach. It is because of its cross-cutting nature that tourism has become a key pillar of the Sustainable Development Agenda and why tourism also forms part of the UN’s socio-economic response to COVID-19.\nSecond, \ngovernments must approach tourism recovery in a more integrated manner \n– involving all levels of government, private sector and civil society in a practical and actionable plan to revive the tourism sector. Tourism services are interdependent. The fragmented and diverse nature of the sector means it sits across various policy areas such as health, transport, environment, foreign affairs, and economic policies. All countries should also reinforce their coordination mechanisms to help businesses, workers and destinations, particularly those that are most vulnerable such as SMEs, with sustainability as a guiding principle for recovery. To achieve a sustainable and resilient tourism economy, the private sector must also be closely involved in policy design. This will help tackle long-standing challenges such as resource efficiency and management, and avoid existing problems including overcrowding and pressure on local infrastructure, the environment and communities. Recovery policies should aim to accelerate the digital transformation and the transition towards a low carbon economy for the future.\nThird, \nwe need to reshape tourism towards responsibility and inclusion.  \nThe tourism sector, can have an important environmental and social effect, whether through greenhouse gas emissions, by impacting fragile natural and cultural environments or affecting host communities. Research indicates that tourism transport related emissions account for 8% of global green house gas emissions. The pandemic has revealed an opportunity for more diversified, ‘slower’, smaller, and more authentic experiences. We need to engage in a collective reflection on the future of tourism and on the sensitive links between tourism and the environment. We need more investment in technology, green infrastructure and value-added jobs. These will lead to a more sustainable, inclusive and resilient tourism sector. \nZurab Pololikashvili\n\rSecretary-General of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)\nÁngel Gurría\n\rSecretary General of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\n"},

The AlUla Framework – named after Saudi Arabia’s first UNESCO world heritage site – demonstrates how the tourism sector can promote inclusive community development by highlighting practical examples and case studies that governments can emulate to protect local culture and the environment, while empowering local communities, especially women and young people. The Framework is a vital tool to be used as we work together to rebuild the tourism sector to be more sustainable, resilient and inclusive.\nCalling for a model of tourism development based on Public-Private-Community (PPC) partnerships, the Framework includes a set of concrete programmes and initiatives based around four pillars of action – empowerment, safeguarding, prosperity and collaboration.  It further defines the \nkey areas of measurement for the impact of tourism\n in the communities in line with the Measuring Sustainable Tourism Initiative, led by UNWTO. \nAmong the G20 Guidelines for Inclusive Community Development through Tourism endorsed at the meeting, is the importance of \nplacing tourism at the heart of development policies\n at international, national and local level. The Guidelines further stress the importance of human capital development, inclusive labor markets, adequate social protection, and innovation and entrepreneurship as key contributors to travel and tourism as a human-centered sector, as well as to advancing \nwomen’s empowerment\n and to create decent jobs for all.  \nNote:\nThe Framework was developed by UNWTO and the G20 Tourism Working Group in collaboration with the IE Center for the Governance of Change and the academic contribution of the University of Surrey.  The Framework includes the contributions of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Bank Group and the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).\n"},

On the back of the meetings, it was confirmed that the issue of easing \ntravel restrictions will be on the agenda at the next meeting of the European Council\n, highlighting the importance and timeliness of UNWTO’s interventions. \nSecretary-General Pololikashvili said: “Tourism is a central pillar of European economies, a leading employer and a source of opportunity for many millions of people across the continent. The leaders of the European Institutions have signalled their commitment to supporting tourism at this challenging time. High-level leadership and unprecedented levels of cooperation between the Institutions, governments and businesses will be needed to translate good intentions into firm actions and so help tourism lead the continent’s recovery from crisis.”\nSecretary-General Pololikashvili congratulated European leaders for their role in opening the borders of EU Member States before the end of the summer season. This gave some much needed impetus to travel and tourism and saw a promising upturn in international tourist arrivals in several European markets.\nUNWTO calls on governments to \navoid acting unilaterally\n and closing borders as this has proven not to be effective in controlling the spread of the virus. It is vital that the focus shifts from limiting travel to ensuring safe travel by putting in place measures like widely accessible, fast testing at departure. Such measures will protect the health of travellers as well as tourism- and travel-related workers, while at the same time fostering trust and boosting confidence.\nTourism contributes 10% of total GDP for the European Union and supports more than 2.4 million businesses. The sector is on track for a fall of between \n60% and 90% in bookings \ncompared to similar periods in previous years. The estimated revenue loss this year for hotels and restaurants, tour operators, long distance rail and for cruises and airlines is from 85% to 90%. As a result of this pandemic, 6 million people may lose their jobs.\nThis visit to Brussels comes on the back of the \nEuropean Tourism Convention\n, during which Mr. Pololikashvili stressed the importance of supporting and promoting green investments in tourism so as to drive sustainable recovery from the present crisis.\n"},

The Sixth meeting of the", "detail": "            Consistent and harmonized travel protocols, enhanced  safety measures and the protection of jobs and livelihoods are the main  ingredients needed for the restart of tourism. The Sixth meeting of the \nUNWTO  Global Tourism Crisis Committee\n reminded participants of the need to work  together as the only means of advancing the sustainable recovery of the sector.  The meeting produced a commitment to create a new UNWTO Committee on Common  Safety Protocols to increase confidence in international travel, as well as  firm plans for enhanced consumer protection for consumers and measures to  protect jobs.            \nSetting the tone for the meeting, UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili made clear that, with many millions of livelihoods at stake\n, inaction is not an option\n, and that the \nrapid and sustainable recovery of tourism\n is essential.\n“Strong coordination is needed to accelerate the lifting of travel restrictions in a safe and timely manner, to increase investment in systems that support safe travel, including testing on departure, and to sustain and support businesses and jobs. If we fail to address these three priorities, we will fail to restart tourism, and so fail to save millions of livelihoods”, Mr. Pololikashvili said.\nThis call for coordination was echoed by a \ndiverse range of voices \nfrom the top level of politics of all global regions, including  interventions from the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Tourism of Spain, Reyes Maroto; Ahmed bin Aqil Al Khateeb, Minister of Tourism of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; Khaled El-Enany, Minister of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt;  Dato’ Sri Hajah Nancy Shukri, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture of Malaysia;  Abdulla Mausoom, Minister of Tourism of the Maldives; Rita Marques, Secretary of State for Tourism for Portugal and Jose Luis Uriarte, Sub-Secretary of Tourism of Chile.\n                      Strong coordination is needed to accelerate the lifting of travel restrictions in a safe and timely manner, to increase investment in systems that support safe travel, including testing on departure, and to sustain and support businesses and jobs                  \nAt a practical level, a proposal for a new set of \ncommon travel protocols\n was put forward by Harry Theoharis, Minister of Tourism of Greece, and welcomed by UNWTO’s leadership and other members of the Committee. Furthermore, illustrating how safe, international travel can return, Marco Troncone, CEO of Rome Fiumicino Airport highlighted the role robust hygiene protocols and innovation can play in boosting consumer confidence.\nAlong the same lines, ICC Secretary-General John Denton, explained plans for a \ncomprehensive system of testing on departure\n to raise consumer confidence and take away the need for quarantine on arrival. Alongside them, Adam Goldstein, Global Chairman of CLIA, and a Luis Felipe Oliveira, Director General of Airports Council International made clear the proactive measures undertaken to cruise tourism and air travel safe for both passengers and workers.\nJust as people are at the driving force of global tourism, so too has UNWTO stressed that recovery policies must recovery be \npeople-focused\n. For starters, restoring consumer trust and coherent and standardized international protocols are mutually reinforcing and critical for the return of tourism. The Crisis Committee meeting saw UNWTO announce plans for a new \nInternational Code for the Protection of Tourists\n. This will be the first legal framework to protect tourists’ rights as consumers, harmonizing minimum standards across different countries and ensuring the fair distribution of responsibility to tourists affecting by the pandemic among stakeholders across the sector.\nA technical committee for the creation of the Code is being set up and will meet before the end of the month. Alongside this, UNWTO is working to protect jobs and help workers affected by the pandemic find new opportunities. Addressing the Committee Kamal Ahluwaila of tech company Eightfold.ai outlined the new Jobs Factory portal, launched with UNTWO in order to unite jobseekers with employers.\nReflecting UNWTOs high-level relations with European institutions, the European Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders addressed the Committee to outline plans to introduce common criteria for restrictions on travel across the EU. UNWTO advocated for non-EU Members to be considered part of this movement towards standardisation, particularly the common colour-coded mapping system currently being rolled out for the safe relaunch of free moment.  And reflecting UNWTO’s status as part of the wider UN response to COVID-19, ICAO Secretary-General Fang Liu, was joined by representatives from IATA, ILO, IMO the WHO and  for the virtual meeting, in addition to representation from the OECD.\nLeveraging its unrivalled status as the global leader of tourism, UNWTO united leaders from across the sector. From its first meeting, the UNWTO Global Crisis Committee has provided a \nplatform for governments, businesses and international bodies\n to express their concerns and share ideas for the restart of tourism. The Committee’s composition reflects not only \nUNWTO’s unique influence and status\n as a part of the United Nations but also \ntourism’s importance for every global region\n and the sector’s cross-cutting nature. Members are drawn from all parts of the world and include government Ministers, leaders and key representatives of International Organizations and UN agencies and from tourism’s private sector.\n"},

As the United Nations specialized agency releases its Global Guidelines for Reopening Tourism, signalling a transition into gearing up for stronger and better recovery, 3% of all global destinations have now taken steps to ease travel restrictions.             \nUNWTO has been monitoring the global response to COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. The fourth edition of its \nCOVID-19 Related Travel Restrictions: A Global Review for Tourism \nreport, released today, again looked at the \nmeasures of 217 destinations worldwide \nas of 18 May 2020. The research shows that 7 destinations have eased travel restrictions for international tourism purposes. At the same time, several more destinations are engaged in \nsignificant discussions about the re-opening of borders\n.\nThe report notes that \n100% of all destinations worldwide continue to have some form of COVID-19-related travel restrictions\n in place. Furthermore, as of 18 May 75% continued to have their borders completely closed for international tourism. In 37% of all cases, travel restrictions have been in place for 10 weeks, while 24% of global destinations have had restrictions in place for 14 weeks or more.\nUNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “The timely and responsible easing of travel restrictions will help ensure the many social and economic benefits that tourism guarantees will return in a sustainable way. This will contribute to the livelihoods of many millions of people around the world. The sector is a driver of sustainable development and a pillar of economies.

While tourism has been the hardest hit of all the world’s major economic sectors, UNWTO has led a joint response and last week released its \nGlobal Guidelines to Reopen Tourism\n. These guidelines outline the steps governments and the private sector can take to \naccelerate recovery\n in the months ahead.\nLooking into global travel restrictions more closely, the UNWTO research shows that, the more important tourism is to the economies of individual destinations, the more likely they are to have introduced complete border closures. In the case of SIDS destinations (Small Island Developing States), \n85% continue to have their borders completely closed\n for tourism purposes.\nAll UNWTO regions have more than 65% of their destinations completely closed to tourism: Africa (74%), Americas (86%), Asia and the Pacific (67%), Europe (74%) and the Middle East (69%).\nThe \nCOVID-19-Related Travel Restrictions\n report also breaks down the level and type of travel restrictions in place, including prevalence of flight suspensions and measures including compulsory self-isolation and quarantine of tourist arrivals.

Around the world, many millions of people are eagerly waiting for tourism to restart. For many, their livelihoods depend on it.\nFor this reason, UNWTO has pledged to not stand still. Even where others urge caution, we have a responsibility to move forwards – and to bring the rest of the sector, as well as political leaders, with us.\nThe sixth meeting of our Global Tourism Crisis Committee emphasized just how determined every part of global tourism is to get moving again. Once again, through the Committee we succeeded in bringing together a wide range of voices, reflecting the diversity of tourism itself. These included both political and business leaders – those in a position to transform ideas into action.\nOnly together are we stronger. We will draw on both the power of the private sector and the determination of governments to introduce a new set of Common Safety Protocols for tourism.\nThese will provide a clear and harmonized set of safety and hygiene protocols, vital if we are to raise confidence in international travel.\nAt the same time, we realize that people don’t just want to feel safe when they travel. They also want to be reassured that they will be supported in times of uncertainty.\nFor this reason, UNWTO will also establish an International Code for the Protection of Tourists, and we are working to ensure all our Member States, not just those in the EU zone, are included in plans to for the safe relaunch of free movement of people across Europe.\nAll of our actions are guided by clear, objective analysis of this rapidly-evolving situation.\nJust as misinformation about the health risks of COVID-19 puts lives at risk, so too does misinformation about the safety of international travel place livelihoods in jeopardy.\nFrom the very start of this crisis, UNWTO has been the trusted, verified source of information for every part of our sector, as well as for governments and international organizations. Our data and insights have guided tourism’s response and now inform its recovery.\nAs the UN celebrates 75 years of cooperation and progress, we stand behind the “Verified” campaign, launched by Secretary-General António Guterres to prevent the spread of false information while at the same time respecting freedom of opinion.\nInternational travel can return safely – we have seen this first-hand through the return of in-person events. And we are working closely with airlines, airports and tourism accommodation providers to make clear that tourism is proactively leading the way in adapting to our new reality.\nThe benefits of restarting tourism will be felt far beyond our sector. It will help kickstart the recovery of our economies and societies.\nAnd it will help us begin the next 75 years of the United Nations’ mission to bring peace and prosperity for all, with the determination to leave nobody behind.\nUNWTO Secretary-General\n\r\nZurab Pololikashvili\n"},

The \nUNWTO Agenda for Africa\n has been realigned to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and to accelerate recovery. Building on this, ahead of their Regional Commission meeting this week, members from across the Americas will further their determination to advocate for tourism as a pillar of post-COVID-19 recovery.\nWe are always \n#StrongerTogether\nSuch a \ncommitment to international cooperation\n will be important as we move forward and rebuild confidence and trust. The World Committee on Tourism Ethics, an independent body convened by UNWTO, has stressed the importance of safeguarding the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism as travel restrictions are eased. Restarting our sector must be done in a timely and responsible manner, avoiding at all costs coming at the expense of \nfair and equal treatment of tourists\n. \nAs we join the world in celebrating this year’s \nSustainable Gastronomy Day\n, chefs from every global region have given us a first taste of what to expect when we travel again, and highlighted the unique potential of gastronomy tourism to preserve unique culture and create opportunities for rural communities.   \nAt the same time, our celebration of innovation and entrepreneurship makes clear that this restart offers the opportunity to reimagine not only how we travel, but how tourism can help build a \nbetter future\n for people and planet.\nUNWTO Secretary-General \n\r\nZurab Pololikashvili \n"},

The government has announced will soon open its borders to tourists from within the European Union. At the same time, the Spanish government has announced a \nsupport package\n worth 4.2 billion Euros for tourism, a sector that supports millions of jobs across the country.  \nSecretary-General Pololikashvili said: “By restarting tourism, and doing so in a responsible manner that protects the most vulnerable while safeguarding jobs and economic growth, Spain can send a strong signal to the rest of the world.

At the same time, \nrestrictions on travel remain in place\n in a majority of global destinations, and tourism remains one of the worst affected of all sectors.\nAgainst this backdrop, UNWTO has reiterated its call for governments and international organizations to support tourism, a \nlifeline for many millions\n and a backbone of economies.\n                      Until tourism’s restart is underway everywhere, UNWTO again calls for strong support for the sector in order to protect jobs and businesses                  \nThe gradual lifting of restrictions in some countries, together with the creation of travel corridors, the resumption of some international flights and \nenhanced safety and hygiene protocols\n, are among the measures being introduced by governments as they look to restart tourism.\nUNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “The sudden and massive fall in tourist numbers threatens jobs and economies. It is vital, therefore, that the restart of tourism is made a priority and managed responsibly, protecting the most vulnerable and with health and safety as a the sector’s number one concern. Until tourism’s restart is underway everywhere, UNWTO again calls for strong support for the sector in order to protect jobs and businesses. We therefore welcome the steps undertaken by both the European Union and individual countries including France and Spain to support tourism economically and build the foundations for recovery.”\nWhile April was expected to be one of the busiest times of the year due to the Easter holidays, the near-universal introduction of travel restrictions led to a \nfall of 97% in international tourist arrivals.\n This follows a 55% decline in March. Between January and April 2020, international tourist arrivals declined by 44%, translating into a loss of about US$195 billion in international tourism receipts.\nAt the regional level, Asia and the Pacific was the first to be hit by the pandemic and the worst hit between January and April, with arrivals down 51% in that period. Europe recorded the second-largest fall, with a 44% drop for the same period, followed by the Middle East (-40%), the Americas (-36%) and Africa (-35%).\nIn early May, UNWTO set out \nthree possible scenarios\n for the tourism sector in 2020. These point to potential declines in overall international tourist numbers of 58% to 78%, depending on when travel restrictions are lifted. Since mid-May, UNWTO has identified an increase in the number of destinations announcing measures to restart tourism. These include the introduction of enhanced safety and hygiene measures and policies designed to promote domestic tourism.\n \n"},

Both visits recognize how tourism is a lifeline for many countries and highlights support for tourism at every political levels and the close collaboration with the private sector.\nThe UNWTO Regional Director for Europe, Alessandra Priante, said: “Health and safety, including the state of healthcare systems, are now key elements for all destinations. This needs to be reflected in their marketing and communications strategies, both now as tourism restarts and into the future as the sector recovers. Tourism has proven its resilience and its unique ability to drive the recovery and development of societies and it will do so again, and this time sustainability and innovation must be front and centre.”\nAlongside meetings with public sector leaders, the UNWTO delegation also saw first-hand the steps being taken by the private sector to ensure the highest level of public safety and hygiene in tourism destinations.\nIn parallel, UNWTO officials visited each of the eight islands of the Canarian Archipelago to see first-hand the safety protocols put in place to \nmaximize security and safety\n. A group of up to 60 Spanish and international media also witnessed the safety updates along the whole tourism value chain.\n"},

The Barometer also shows a 56% year-on-year drop in tourist arrivals between January and May.

The dramatic fall in international tourism places many millions of livelihoods at risk, including in developing countries. Governments in every world region have a dual responsibility: to prioritize public health while also protecting jobs and businesses. They also need to maintain the spirit of cooperation and solidarity that has defined our response to this shared challenge and refrain from making unilateral decisions that may undermine the trust and confidence we have been working so hard to build.”\nRestart underway but confidence low \nAt the same time, UNWTO also notes signs of a gradual and cautious change in trend, most notably in the Northern Hemisphere and particularly following the opening of borders across the Schengen Zone of the European Union on 1 July.\nWhile \ntourism is slowly returning in some destinations\n, the UNWTO Confidence Index has dropped to record lows, both for the evaluation of the period January-April 2020, and the prospects for May-August. Most members of the UNWTO Panel of Tourism Experts expect international tourism to recover by the second half of 2021, followed by those who expect a rebound in the first part of next year. \nThe group of global experts points to a series of downside risks such as travel restrictions and border shutdowns still in place in most destinations, major outbound markets such as the United States and China being at standstill, safety concerns associated with travel, \nthe resurgence of the virus and risks of new lockdowns\n or curfews. Furthermore, concerns over a lack of reliable information and a deteriorating economic environment are indicated as factors weighing on consumer confidence.\n"},

This latest outlook, recorded on 19 July, is \nup from 22% of destinations\n that had eased restrictions on travel by 15 June and the 3% previously observed by 15 May.

The report also shows that around half (41) of all those destinations that have eased restrictions are in Europe, confirming the leading role of the region for the responsible restart of tourism.\nMany destinations still in long-term lockdown\nLooking at the 115 destinations that continue to have their borders completely closed to international tourism, the report finds that a majority (88) have been completely closed their borders for international tourism for \nmore than 12 weeks\n.\nThe cost related to the travel restrictions introduced in response to COVID-19 has historic dimensions. This week, UNWTO released the data on the impact of the pandemic on tourism, both in terms of lost tourist arrivals and lost revenues.

With the sector currently facing up to the biggest crisis in its history, today’s signing was a clear sign that Member States are looking to UNWTO for firm leadership and remain committed to its mission to use this pause as an opportunity to realign tourism.\nThe Convention was hailed as a “big step forward” towards introducing a universal, legally binding ethical code for tourism, one of the world’s most important socio-economic sectors. In a special ceremony attended by the country’s Ambassador to Spain Bapak Hermono and hosted at the UNWTO headquarters, Indonesia became the \nfirst country to sign\n, signalling its strong commitment to uphold the highest ethical principles as it expands its tourism sector.\nIndonesia played an important role in the drafting of the Convention as part of the Committee that converted the Global Code of Ethics in Tourism into an international legally binding instrument. A Member State since 1975, it is currently working with UNWTO to \nrestart tourism\n in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2020, UNWTO conducted a virtual meeting with the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy to explore solutions for the safe reopening of Bali to international visitors. In this regard, technical assistance from UNWTO will be provided in due course.\n"},

For this to happen, even greater collaboration between the public and private sectors is needed. This enhanced partnership with the World Tourism Organization will help guide aviation’s recovery over the critical months ahead.”\nIATA has been an Affiliate Member of UNWTO since 1978, providing a strong voice for the international air transport sector. IATA is also an active member of the Board of the UNWTO’s Affiliate Members and contributed to the UNWTO Global Guidelines to Restart Tourism, released in May to help guide governments and the private sector in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This collaboration was reflected in the final publication. A set distinct set of recommendations for the air transport sector were included, with a focus on the introduction of enhanced hygiene protocols to guarantee the safety of both passengers and airline workers. The Global Guidelines also emphasized the need for strong partnership and coordination at every level of the airline sector.\nThis latest partnership comes as UNWTO continues to lead the global tourism sector in its response to the challenges posed by the pandemic. As well as close cooperation with private sector associations and businesses, UNWTO also recently signed an agreement with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), that will see the two UN agencies work together to harness the power of tourism to drive the sustainable social and economic development of rural communities.\n"},

The Framework provides specific recommendations and tools to support both governments as well as all other key stakeholders in the tourism sector – including regional and local governments, the private sector, industry associations, civil society, communities and tourists – fostering a truly holistic and integrated approach to inclusive community development through tourism.\nUNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “As we join forces to restart tourism, we must live up to our responsibility to ensure that tourism’s benefits are shared by all.

The Framework is a vital tool to be used as we work together to rebuild the tourism sector to be more sustainable, resilient and inclusive.\nCalling for a model of tourism development based on Public-Private-Community (PPC) partnerships, the Framework includes a set of concrete programmes and initiatives based around four pillars of action – empowerment, safeguarding, prosperity and collaboration.  It further defines the \nkey areas of measurement for the impact of tourism\n in the communities in line with the Measuring Sustainable Tourism Initiative, led by UNWTO. \nAmong the G20 Guidelines for Inclusive Community Development through Tourism endorsed at the meeting, is the importance of \nplacing tourism at the heart of development policies\n at international, national and local level. The Guidelines further stress the importance of human capital development, inclusive labor markets, adequate social protection, and innovation and entrepreneurship as key contributors to travel and tourism as a human-centered sector, as well as to advancing \nwomen’s empowerment\n and to create decent jobs for all.  \nNote:\nThe Framework was developed by UNWTO and the G20 Tourism Working Group in collaboration with the IE Center for the Governance of Change and the academic contribution of the University of Surrey.  The Framework includes the contributions of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Bank Group and the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).\n"},

During his visit to Brussels, Mr. Pololikashvili urged the leaders of the European institutions to transform the ambitious plans for the recovery into reality by coordinating a package of response measures that will allow for tourism to return and to drive the recovery of the EU economy.\nAt the same time, the UNWTO leadership stressed the importance of supporting and growing \ndomestic tourism\n. According to Mr Pololikashvili, domestic tourism has immense potential, including for the recovery and development of rural communities. However, for this potential to be realized, governments and the European Institutions need to provide \ngreater direction and stronger leadership\n.\n                      Tourism is a central pillar of European economies, a leading employer and a source of opportunity for many millions of people across the continent                  \nThe UNWTO delegation met with Mr. Margaritis Schinas, Vice President of the European Commission, Mr. Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for Internal Market, Mr. Virginijus Sinkevičius, European Commissioner for Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, with the office of Mr. David Sassoli, President of the European Parliament and key representatives of the European Council. On the back of the meetings, it was confirmed that the issue of easing \ntravel restrictions will be on the agenda at the next meeting of the European Council\n, highlighting the importance and timeliness of UNWTO’s interventions. \nSecretary-General Pololikashvili said: “Tourism is a central pillar of European economies, a leading employer and a source of opportunity for many millions of people across the continent. The leaders of the European Institutions have signalled their commitment to supporting tourism at this challenging time. High-level leadership and unprecedented levels of cooperation between the Institutions, governments and businesses will be needed to translate good intentions into firm actions and so help tourism lead the continent’s recovery from crisis.”\nSecretary-General Pololikashvili congratulated European leaders for their role in opening the borders of EU Member States before the end of the summer season. This gave some much needed impetus to travel and tourism and saw a promising upturn in international tourist arrivals in several European markets.\nUNWTO calls on governments to \navoid acting unilaterally\n and closing borders as this has proven not to be effective in controlling the spread of the virus. It is vital that the focus shifts from limiting travel to ensuring safe travel by putting in place measures like widely accessible, fast testing at departure. Such measures will protect the health of travellers as well as tourism- and travel-related workers, while at the same time fostering trust and boosting confidence.\nTourism contributes 10% of total GDP for the European Union and supports more than 2.4 million businesses. The sector is on track for a fall of between \n60% and 90% in bookings \ncompared to similar periods in previous years. The estimated revenue loss this year for hotels and restaurants, tour operators, long distance rail and for cruises and airlines is from 85% to 90%. As a result of this pandemic, 6 million people may lose their jobs.\nThis visit to Brussels comes on the back of the \nEuropean Tourism Convention\n, during which Mr. Pololikashvili stressed the importance of supporting and promoting green investments in tourism so as to drive sustainable recovery from the present crisis.\n"},

If we fail to address these three priorities, we will fail to restart tourism, and so fail to save millions of livelihoods”, Mr. Pololikashvili said.\nThis call for coordination was echoed by a \ndiverse range of voices \nfrom the top level of politics of all global regions, including  interventions from the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Tourism of Spain, Reyes Maroto; Ahmed bin Aqil Al Khateeb, Minister of Tourism of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; Khaled El-Enany, Minister of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt;  Dato’ Sri Hajah Nancy Shukri, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture of Malaysia;  Abdulla Mausoom, Minister of Tourism of the Maldives; Rita Marques, Secretary of State for Tourism for Portugal and Jose Luis Uriarte, Sub-Secretary of Tourism of Chile.\n                      Strong coordination is needed to accelerate the lifting of travel restrictions in a safe and timely manner, to increase investment in systems that support safe travel, including testing on departure, and to sustain and support businesses and jobs                  \nAt a practical level, a proposal for a new set of \ncommon travel protocols\n was put forward by Harry Theoharis, Minister of Tourism of Greece, and welcomed by UNWTO’s leadership and other members of the Committee. Furthermore, illustrating how safe, international travel can return, Marco Troncone, CEO of Rome Fiumicino Airport highlighted the role robust hygiene protocols and innovation can play in boosting consumer confidence.\nAlong the same lines, ICC Secretary-General John Denton, explained plans for a \ncomprehensive system of testing on departure\n to raise consumer confidence and take away the need for quarantine on arrival. Alongside them, Adam Goldstein, Global Chairman of CLIA, and a Luis Felipe Oliveira, Director General of Airports Council International made clear the proactive measures undertaken to cruise tourism and air travel safe for both passengers and workers.\nJust as people are at the driving force of global tourism, so too has UNWTO stressed that recovery policies must recovery be \npeople-focused\n. For starters, restoring consumer trust and coherent and standardized international protocols are mutually reinforcing and critical for the return of tourism. The Crisis Committee meeting saw UNWTO announce plans for a new \nInternational Code for the Protection of Tourists\n. This will be the first legal framework to protect tourists’ rights as consumers, harmonizing minimum standards across different countries and ensuring the fair distribution of responsibility to tourists affecting by the pandemic among stakeholders across the sector.\nA technical committee for the creation of the Code is being set up and will meet before the end of the month. Alongside this, UNWTO is working to protect jobs and help workers affected by the pandemic find new opportunities. Addressing the Committee Kamal Ahluwaila of tech company Eightfold.ai outlined the new Jobs Factory portal, launched with UNTWO in order to unite jobseekers with employers.\nReflecting UNWTOs high-level relations with European institutions, the European Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders addressed the Committee to outline plans to introduce common criteria for restrictions on travel across the EU. UNWTO advocated for non-EU Members to be considered part of this movement towards standardisation, particularly the common colour-coded mapping system currently being rolled out for the safe relaunch of free moment.  And reflecting UNWTO’s status as part of the wider UN response to COVID-19, ICAO Secretary-General Fang Liu, was joined by representatives from IATA, ILO, IMO the WHO and  for the virtual meeting, in addition to representation from the OECD.\nLeveraging its unrivalled status as the global leader of tourism, UNWTO united leaders from across the sector. From its first meeting, the UNWTO Global Crisis Committee has provided a \nplatform for governments, businesses and international bodies\n to express their concerns and share ideas for the restart of tourism. The Committee’s composition reflects not only \nUNWTO’s unique influence and status\n as a part of the United Nations but also \ntourism’s importance for every global region\n and the sector’s cross-cutting nature. Members are drawn from all parts of the world and include government Ministers, leaders and key representatives of International Organizations and UN agencies and from tourism’s private sector.\n"},

Around the world, many millions of people are eagerly waiting for tourism to restart. For many, their livelihoods depend on it.\nFor this reason, UNWTO has pledged to not stand still. Even where others urge caution, we have a responsibility to move forwards – and to bring the rest of the sector, as well as political leaders, with us.\nThe sixth meeting of our Global Tourism Crisis Committee emphasized just how determined every part of global tourism is to get moving again. Once again, through the Committee we succeeded in bringing together a wide range of voices, reflecting the diversity of tourism itself. These included both political and business leaders – those in a position to transform ideas into action.\nOnly together are we stronger. We will draw on both the power of the private sector and the determination of governments to introduce a new set of Common Safety Protocols for tourism.\nThese will provide a clear and harmonized set of safety and hygiene protocols, vital if we are to raise confidence in international travel.\nAt the same time, we realize that people don’t just want to feel safe when they travel. They also want to be reassured that they will be supported in times of uncertainty.\nFor this reason, UNWTO will also establish an International Code for the Protection of Tourists, and we are working to ensure all our Member States, not just those in the EU zone, are included in plans to for the safe relaunch of free movement of people across Europe.\nAll of our actions are guided by clear, objective analysis of this rapidly-evolving situation.\nJust as misinformation about the health risks of COVID-19 puts lives at risk, so too does misinformation about the safety of international travel place livelihoods in jeopardy.\nFrom the very start of this crisis, UNWTO has been the trusted, verified source of information for every part of our sector, as well as for governments and international organizations. Our data and insights have guided tourism’s response and now inform its recovery.\nAs the UN celebrates 75 years of cooperation and progress, we stand behind the “Verified” campaign, launched by Secretary-General António Guterres to prevent the spread of false information while at the same time respecting freedom of opinion.\nInternational travel can return safely – we have seen this first-hand through the return of in-person events. And we are working closely with airlines, airports and tourism accommodation providers to make clear that tourism is proactively leading the way in adapting to our new reality.\nThe benefits of restarting tourism will be felt far beyond our sector. It will help kickstart the recovery of our economies and societies.\nAnd it will help us begin the next 75 years of the United Nations’ mission to bring peace and prosperity for all, with the determination to leave nobody behind.\nUNWTO Secretary-General\n\r\nZurab Pololikashvili\n"},

This restart must be managed cautiously and responsibly, with public health the primary concern, and making full use of innovation. The WORLD TOURIST IDENTIFICATION app promises to facilitate travel across international borders, promoting trust and building confidence in tourism, essential foundations for the sector’s recovery.”\nSince the start of the current crisis, UNWTO has been promoting the \npower of innovation\n to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on tourism and to prepare the sector to recover better and stronger, such as the \nUNWTO Healing Solutions for Tourism Challenge\n which attracted more than 1,000 applications from innovators and entrepreneurs in more than 100 countries.\n"},

As a sector, tourism is a leading global employer and, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO), more than half of all workers in the accommodation and food services sector in most SIDS reporting data are women. In many, this proportion is even higher, including in Haiti and Trinidad and Tobago (70%+).\nAt the same time, \nworkers in the informal economy\n are at risk of falling into poverty as the impact of COVID-19 is felt in SIDS and other low- and middle-income countries worldwide, UNWTO also warns.\n"},

Since launching his own company in 1975, Giorgio Armani has become synonymous with Italian style. As a chef, Gino Sorbillo celebrates traditional Nepalese pizza and has opened award-winning restaurants around the world. \nUNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “Italy is one of the world’s most famous tourist destinations. Each year, millions of people visit to enjoy its culture, its fashion and its gastronomy. In return, tourism supports livelihoods and local and regional economies and helps preserve this Italian culture. As UNWTO Special Ambassador for Tourism, Giorgio Armani can help amplify UNWTO’s key messages of the power of tourism to create opportunities and drive growth. As UNWTO Special Ambassador for Gastronomy Tourism, Gino Sorbillo will showcase the unique ability of gastronomy to preserve and promote heritage and give tourists a unique taste of the destinations they visit.”\nUpon receiving the plaque, Mr Armani said: ‘I am genuinely pleased to have been honoured in this way by an organisation that believes that people should be encouraged to see the beauty of the globe in a respectful and responsible manner. It has been a sense of responsibility for our community that has helped my country through this terrible pandemic, and this too is what has driven me to play my small part in helping those engaged in the fight against the virus, and the fight against the economic challenges it has posed. A belief in community – the global community – and an appreciation of the humanity we all share are what will help us build a better future for ourselves and the generations to come, through being mindful of the important things in life, like the preciousness of the environment and our duty to protect it. It is therefore an honour to take up the role of Special Ambassador for Tourism.’\nThe appointments also strengthen UNWTO’s strong relationship with Italy, the first Member State to receive a visit from the organization’s leadership since destinations around the world introduced restrictions on travel in response to the pandemic. The UNWTO delegation led by the Secretary-General will visit Rome, Italy, Milan and Venice and work with both the national and city authorities to support tourism’s restart and ensure this goes hand-in-hand with wider economic and social recovery.\n"},

The annual series of meetings got underway with the Regional Commission for Africa, and this was followed by meetings of the Regional Commissions for the Americas, Europe, Asia and the Pacific and finally the Middle East region. In all instances, representatives of Member States, including Ministers of Tourism, were joined UNWTO Affiliate Members, including leaders from across the private sector.\nUNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “The meetings of the UNWTO Regional Commissions has shown the \nuniversal determination to restart tourism\n, and to do so with an \nemphasis on sustainability\n and on ensuring the benefits are shared as widely as possible. At the same time, the insights of UNWTO Member States from around the world make clear that, while some destinations are re-opening to tourists, this crisis is not yet over in many places, and that the tourism sector continues to require \nstrong political and economic support\n if we are to safeguard livelihoods and protect whole economies in these challenging times.”\n \n                      The meetings of the UNWTO Regional Commissions has shown the universal determination to restart tourism, and to do so with an emphasis on sustainability and on ensuring the benefits are shared as widely as possible                  \nIn the final meeting of this round, the Regional Commission for the Middle East featured nine Ministers of Tourism, as well as representatives from the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, the Arab Tourism Organization, the League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Islamic Development Board.\nChaired by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the virtual meeting focused on ensuring all destinations are ready to welcome tourists back, with enhanced hygiene protocols in place so as to make \ntourists feel safe and confident\n. Discussions also centred on the important role \ninnovation\n and \ndigital transformation\n will play in the future of tourism across the Middle East region.\n\r\n\rIn all cases, UNWTO’s leadership used the occasion of the meetings of the Regional Commissions to share the practical and technical support made available to both governments and the private sector. The \nUNWTO Guidelines for Restarting Tourism\n provide a clear action plan for growing back stronger and better, and the \nTourism Recovery Technical Assistance Package\n outlines the support available to all Member States, including assistance in devising new marketing strategies.\n"},

Instead, \nnations from the MERCOSUR Member States \n(Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, with Chile joining as Member Associate status) will serve as \njoint hosts.\n This co-hosting agreement exemplifies the \nspirit of international solidarity\n that runs through tourism and which UNWTO has recognized as essential for recovery.\nUNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “All around the world, tourism empowers rural communities, providing jobs and opportunity, most notably for women and youth. Tourism also enables rural communities to hold onto their unique cultural heritage and traditions, and the sector is vital for safeguarding habitat and endangered species. This World Tourism Day is a chance to recognize the role tourism plays outside of major cities and its ability to build a better future for all.”\nFor countless rural communities around the world, tourism is a leading provider of employment and opportunities. In many places, \nit is one of the few viable economic sectors\n. Moreover, development through tourism can also keep rural communities alive. It is estimated that by 2050, 68% of the world population will live in urban areas, while 80% of those currently living in ‘extreme poverty’ live outside of towns and cities.\nThe situation is particularly hard for youth: young people in rural communities are three times more likely to be unemployed than older adults. \nTourism is a lifeline\n, offering young people a chance to earn a living without having to migrate either within their home countries or abroad.\nWorld Tourism Day 2020 will once again be celebrated by UNWTO’s Member States in all global regions as well as by cities and other destinations and by private sector organizations and individual tourists. It comes as communities in rural areas also struggle with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. These communities are usually much less-prepared to deal with the short and longer-term impacts of the crisis. This is due to a number of factors, including their aging populations, lower income levels and the continuing ‘digital divide’. Tourism offers a solution to all of these challenges.  \n"},

This allows UNWTO to determine the factors that are influencing destinations’ decisions to ease restrictions. Notably, the report shows:\nAt the same time, the report shows that many destinations around the world are extremely cautious about easing travel restrictions they introduced in response to the pandemic and some have passed severe measures in an attempt to keep their citizens safe. 93 destinations (43% of all worldwide destinations) continue to have their \nborders completely closed to tourism, \nof which 27 have had their borders completely closed for at least 30 weeks.\nFurthermore, more than \nhalf of all destinations with borders completely closed\n to tourism are classified as being among the \nWorld’s Most Vulnerable Countries\n.

More than half of destinations with full restrictions still in place are also highly dependent on aviation, with at least 70% of their tourist arrivals coming by air, causing significant connectivity impacts for their citizens and economies.  \nUNWTO continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the tourism. From the start, the UN specialized agency has advised that the \nsituation is fluid\n and that, even as tourism restarts in some regions, in others, restrictions may be tightened and borders re-closed.

This represents an unprecedented decrease, as countries around the world closed their borders and introduced travel restrictions in response to the pandemic.             \nOver recent weeks, a growing number of destinations have started to open up again to international tourists. UNWTO reports that, as of early September, \n53% of destinations had eased travel restrictions\n. Nevertheless, many governments remain cautious, and this latest report shows that the lockdowns introduced during the first half of the year have had a massive impact on international tourism. The sharp and sudden fall in arrivals has placed millions of jobs and businesses at risk.\nAccording to UNWTO, the massive drop in international travel demand over the period January-June 2020 translates into a loss of \n440 million international arrivals\n and about \nUS$ 460 billion\n in export revenues from international tourism. This is around five times the loss in international tourism receipts recorded in 2009 amid the global economic and financial crisis.\n                      Safe and responsible international travel is now possible in many parts of the world, and it is imperative that governments work closely with the private sector to get global tourism moving again                  \nUNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “The latest World Tourism Barometer shows the deep impact this pandemic is having on tourism, a sector upon which millions of people depend for their livelihoods. However, safe and responsible international travel is now possible in many parts of the world, and it is imperative that governments work closely with the private sector to get global tourism moving again. Coordinated action is key.”\nDespite the gradual reopening of many destinations since the second half of May, the anticipated improvement in international tourism numbers during the peak summer season in the Northern Hemisphere did not materialize. Europe was the second-hardest hit of all global regions, with a 66% decline in tourist arrivals in the first half of 2020. The Americas (-55%), Africa and the Middle East (both -57%) also suffered. However, Asia and the Pacific, the first region to feel the impact of COVID-19 on tourism, was the hardest hit, with a 72% fall in tourists for the six-month period.\nAt the sub-regional level, North-East Asia (-83%) and Southern Mediterranean Europe (-72%) suffered the largest declines. All world regions and sub-regions recorded \ndeclines of more than 50% in arrivals\n in January-June 2020. The contraction of international demand is also reflected in double-digit declines in international tourism expenditure among large markets. Major outbound markets such as the United States and China continue to be at a standstill, though some markets such as France and Germany have shown some improvement in June. \nLooking ahead, it seems likely that reduced travel demand and consumer confidence will continue to impact results for the rest of the year. In May, UNWTO outlined three possible scenarios, pointing to declines of 58% to 78% in international tourist arrivals in 2020. Current trends through August point to a drop in demand closer to 70% (Scenario 2), especially now as some destinations re-introduce restrictions on travel.\nThe extension of the scenarios to 2021 point to a change in trend next year, based on the assumptions of a gradual and linear lifting of travel restrictions, the availability of a vaccine or treatment and a return of traveller confidence. Nonetheless, despite this, the return to 2019 levels in terms of tourist arrivals would take between \n2½\n to 4 years.\n"},

This World Tourism Day highlighted our sector’s unique ability to reach those who would otherwise be left behind, providing opportunities for all, transforming lives and protecting the cultural heritage that makes us human.”\nThe celebration was hosted by the MERCOSUR nations (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile as associate member), the first time in the 40-year-history of history of the international day of observance that hosting duties have been shared.\nGermán Cardoso, Minister of Tourism for Uruguay, highlighted rural tourism’s importance for helping countries diversify their markets, noting it offers “sensitive and emotional experiences” for visitors alongside its benefits for the communities themselves. The Minister of Tourism for Argentina Matías Lammen noted that “tourism in South America is regional…whoever visits us usually visits more than one country”, making a joined-up approach to building a “greener future” essential. Marcelo Alvaro Antonio, Minister of Tourism for Brazil, singled out the importance of innovation and investment and the “power of ecotourism and adventure tourism”. For Paraguay, Minister Sofía Elizabeth Montiel de Afara, reaffirmed her government’s “commitment to the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, and its emphasis on working with local communities. The Under-Secretary of Tourism for Chile, José Luis Uriarte, similarly pledged to use tourism to “support rural communities suffering from the economic and social repercussions of this pandemic.”\nTaking part in the round-table discussion that followed were Mario Alberto González Sanchez, Director of Mexican Secretariat of Tourism, and the Chilean chef and UNWTO Special Ambassador, Pilar Rodriguez. Joining them were Lisandro Menu-Marque, Director at Globalia, and Shannon Stowell, CEO of the Professional Adventure Travel Association and the Adventure Travel Fund of the USA.\nUNWTO used the occasion of World Tourism Day to launch its new \nRecommendations on Tourism and Rural Development\n. The new publication outlines the key steps destinations can take to fully harness the potential of tourism to help drive social and economic recovery outside of urban areas.\nRecognising the important role new ideas and technology will play in this, UNWTO also announced the winners of its Rural Tourism Innovation Competition. Organized with the Government of Spain, Google Spain and the Federation of Rural Women’s Associations (FADEMUR). The competition attracted more than 130 applications from across Spain. Almost half of applications (43%) were put forward by women.\n My Street Book\n won the prize in the Innovation category, and the winner of the prize for the start-up with the biggest social impact was \nVan Woow\n.\n"},

This new MoU comes on the back of World Tourism Day 2020, which was celebrated worldwide around the special theme of \nTourism and Rural Development\n. Under the agreement, UNWTO and FAO will build a framework for enhanced collaboration, including through the sharing of knowledge and resources.\nUNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “This Memorandum of Understanding between UNWTO and the FAO emphasises the cross-cutting nature of tourism and the importance of cooperation at every level to ensure the sector works for everyone. Both tourism and agriculture are lifelines for communities around the world. The agreement is particularly timely as it comes as we recognize 2020 as the year of Tourism for Rural Development. This was also the theme of World Tourism Day, which we celebrated this week, highlighting the role tourism must play in providing opportunities for rural communities and driving social and economic recovery.”\n                      This Memorandum of Understanding between UNWTO and the FAO emphasises the cross-cutting nature of tourism and the importance of cooperation at every level to ensure the sector works for everyone.                  \nA central aim of the collaboration will be to increase the \nresilience of rural communities\n against social and economic shocks through growing tourism and making it both more sustainable and inclusive. Across the FAO’s GIAHS (Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems) network of communities, tourism is a leading driver of equality, with the sector \nemploying women and youth\n and giving them a stake in economic growth. Tourism is also a protector of the \nrich cultural heritage\n that characterizes many of the communities within the GIAHS network, for instance through keeping folklore and other traditions alive for future generations.\nMoving forward, the new MoU states that UNWTO and FAO will work together to establish a plan for more specific areas of collaboration. Key priorities, as outlined in the agreement, include encouraging entrepreneurship within rural communities, particularly among youth and women, with the aim of providing them with access to both local and global markets for their products. Other priorities include fostering education and skills so as to provide communities with opportunities within the tourism sector.\n"},

As the United Nations specialized agency releases its Global Guidelines for Reopening Tourism, signalling a transition into gearing up for stronger and better recovery, 3% of all global destinations have now taken steps to ease travel restrictions.             \nUNWTO has been monitoring the global response to COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. The fourth edition of its \nCOVID-19 Related Travel Restrictions: A Global Review for Tourism \nreport, released today, again looked at the \nmeasures of 217 destinations worldwide \nas of 18 May 2020. The research shows that 7 destinations have eased travel restrictions for international tourism purposes. At the same time, several more destinations are engaged in \nsignificant discussions about the re-opening of borders\n.\nThe report notes that \n100% of all destinations worldwide continue to have some form of COVID-19-related travel restrictions\n in place. Furthermore, as of 18 May 75% continued to have their borders completely closed for international tourism. In 37% of all cases, travel restrictions have been in place for 10 weeks, while 24% of global destinations have had restrictions in place for 14 weeks or more.\nUNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “The timely and responsible easing of travel restrictions will help ensure the many social and economic benefits that tourism guarantees will return in a sustainable way. This will contribute to the livelihoods of many millions of people around the world. The sector is a driver of sustainable development and a pillar of economies. UNWTO stresses the need for vigilance, responsibility and international cooperation as the world slowly opens up again.”\n                      UNWTO stresses the need for vigilance, responsibility and international cooperation as the world slowly opens up again                  \nMr Pololikashvili also welcomed the growing confidence in the global tourism sector, noting it stands ready to return to growth. While tourism has been the hardest hit of all the world’s major economic sectors, UNWTO has led a joint response and last week released its \nGlobal Guidelines to Reopen Tourism\n. These guidelines outline the steps governments and the private sector can take to \naccelerate recovery\n in the months ahead.\nLooking into global travel restrictions more closely, the UNWTO research shows that, the more important tourism is to the economies of individual destinations, the more likely they are to have introduced complete border closures. In the case of SIDS destinations (Small Island Developing States), \n85% continue to have their borders completely closed\n for tourism purposes.\nAll UNWTO regions have more than 65% of their destinations completely closed to tourism: Africa (74%), Americas (86%), Asia and the Pacific (67%), Europe (74%) and the Middle East (69%).\nThe \nCOVID-19-Related Travel Restrictions\n report also breaks down the level and type of travel restrictions in place, including prevalence of flight suspensions and measures including compulsory self-isolation and quarantine of tourist arrivals.
