She stressed that today's event was being celebrated by Italians as well as the UN agency and drew attention to the recently-launched Food Coalition, an Italian proposed initiative led by FAO which aims to tackle the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food and agriculture. Minister Bellanova highlighted that food security is an absolute priority, as well as the importance that Italy gives to the right to food. She said the Italian Government was working with its European partners for the promotion of sustainable agri-food systems and intended to include this subject on the agenda of the G20 when Italy assume its Presidency in 2021. Mayor Raggi said she was proud that Rome hosted the UN's three food agencies. She spoke of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public health and food systems around the world, emphasizing the importance of solidarity among people to face this challenging situation.
