During a virtual meeting, FAO Director-General, QU Dongyu, and Giulia Di Tommaso, the President and Chief Executive Officer of CropLife International, signed a Letter of Intent to explore new partnerships between the UN Agency and the private sector. It was the first time that a FAO Director-General delivered a keynote speech to the Board of Directors of CropLife International. In his opening remarks, Qu stressed the importance of having the private sector onboard in the adoption of concrete steps towards agri-food systems transformation and highlighted the potential of digital technologies in this regard.  \"Digitalization is a real engine to transform agri-food systems, from production through processing to the market,\" he said, noting that digital technologies can remodel agri-food systems so that production and trade would be driven by consumers. This would also reduce the impact of food loss and waste.  Qu pointed out that FAO has become more and more digital, and it is working towards the implementation of the International Platform for Digital Food and Agriculture, as he invited CropLife International members to work with FAO and its Members. Referring to the agreement Giulia Di Tommaso described it as a \"milestone for both our organizations\" saying it would reinforce the common goal shared by FAO and CropLife International to build sustainable food systems, boost farmer resilience to climate change and address zero hunger.  The Director-General also stressed that FAO's Hand-in-Hand initiative , a country-owned and country-led initiative now operating in 22 countries, needed partners such as CropLife International and its members to drive it forward by contributing valuable technical knowledge, practical know-how and capital. Hand-in-Hand brings together public and private donors in a matchmaking process to support rural development and eradicate poverty in the world's most vulnerable countries in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.  \"FAO is the facilitator, we are the matchmaker,\" Qu said. Beth Bechdol, FAO Deputy Director-General, told the meeting FAO was looking for \"on the ground impact\" and the UN agency was focused on opening new channels of communication for private sector partners with FAO's country offices and national governments. She said that FAO is undergoing a cultural change, becoming more dynamic, forward-looking and opening up to new ways of work and collaboration. In this sense, Bechdol mentioned that the Organization is developing a new strategy for partnerships with the private sector, which will be submitted to evaluation of FAO Members before the end of 2020.  CropLife International board members were enthusiastic about strengthening the organization's relationship with FAO. Liam Condon, chairman of the CropLife International board, described today's meeting as the start of a new journey. Condon, went on to stress the importance of assisting smallholder farmers, saying there was a lot more companies could do together rather than individually, particularly by engaging with FAO and its technical expertise. CropLife International is a trade association, which promotes agricultural technologies such as pesticides and plant biotechnology. Its members have been working with FAO on a number of initiatives such as improving pesticide management and global action to tackle Fall Armyworm.\n\n"},

Qu spoke on behalf of several UN agencies and represented the United Nations system while participating in a Leaders Dialogue on how to mainstream biodiversity issues into the broader drive for sustainable development. The panel was co-chaired by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan, while interventions were made by more than a dozen heads of government or state from countries such as Belize, Kyrgyzstan and Zambia, along with UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay and the heads of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the International Parliamentary Union and WWF International. The UN summit, engaging Heads of State and Government, comes at the end of the UN Decade on Biodiversity and aims to galvanize and accelerate concrete commitments and action at the 15th Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, to be held in Kunming, China, in 2021, where members should adopt the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. The sustainable use and equitable sharing of benefits from biodiversity are critical for delivery of 14 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Moreover, some 70 percent of drugs used for cancer are natural or synthetic products inspired by nature, and the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how degraded biodiversity undermines the web of life and increases the risk of disease spillovers from wildlife to people. Joining the call for urgent action, FAO's Director-General emphasized the \"need to radically transform our economies and behaviors to make sure that they are inclusive, green and sustainable.\"He emphasized the important links between this summit and the UN Food Systems Summit to be held next year, noting that the futures of our agri-food systems and biodiversity are mutually dependent on transforming the former as well as \"reverence of nature\" adding that \"It is time to bridge our agendas.\" Today, only nine crop species supply nearly 66 percent of total global crop production, while only eight domesticated mammalian and avian species provide more than 95 percent of the human food supply from livestock, according to FAO's extensive work on biodiversity. Reliance on such a narrow set of resources reduces natural insurance effects and weakens the resilience of food security over the long run. What is to be done?Aimed at practicing what they recommend, U.N. agencies are mainstreaming biodiversity across their internal operations, programmes and policies and supports Members in doing the same, with an eye on green development strategies, disaster risk management and the implementation of international agreements and policies to ensure food security, livelihoods and sustainability, the Director-General said. Restoration of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, the use of nature-based solutions, conservation of genetic species and natural resources, green and blue finance, sustainable value changes and changing consumption and production patterns are priority areas for action, he added.Serious acceleration is required. Today, for example, FAO is engaged in land restoration, notably with the Great Green Wall Initiative. But globally, restoration activities cover only 2 percent of the more than two  billion hectares of currently degraded land requiring restoration to enhance biodiversity, ecosystem service and agricultural productivity, according to the Convention on Biological Diversity. On the action front, FAO is a member of the UN Environment Management Group providing inputs for the framework to be launched in Kunming. On the knowledge front, FAO recently produced the first-ever benchmark report, The State of the World's Biodiversity for Food and Agriculture. Among other findings, it highlighted that while national reports confirm that 24 percent of nearly 4, 000 wild food species are decreasing in abundance, there is no data for another 61 percent, signaling that we have evidence of sustainability for fewer than one in six.On the policy front, a new FAO report suggests how an ecosystem-based management approach requires innovation - for example, breeding crops with an eye to their interaction with other crops to improve soil health, reduce the use of toxins in pest management and cope with climate change. \n\n"},

Sustainable tourism in rural areas such as agritourism, ecotourism and pescatourism is an important driver of socio-economic growth that can reduce inequalities, increase resilience of rural communities and boost rural incomes. The new partnership will also contribute to the ecosystems conservation and the development of the FAO's Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS), as well as support the Coalition of Fragile Ecosystems (COFE) - a global alliance of vulnerable communities living in fragile ecosystems that advocates for the protection of mountain and island ecosystems and the resilience of their populations.  FAO Director-General QU Dongyu and UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili signed today the first ever Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two organizations at FAO headquarters in Rome. \"The signing of the Memorandum of Understanding coincides with World Tourism Day this year focusing on Sustainable Tourism for Rural Development, a topic of deep interest for FAO,\" the FAO Director General said.  \"Tourism in rural areas can play a pivotal role in supporting rural economies through income diversification of farmers, job creation and raising public awareness of the significance of rural areas for food security, the environment, for the protection of culinary and cultural heritage, the conservation of local biodiversity and the maintenance of beautiful landscapes,\" he noted. For his part, UNWTO Secretary-General said: \"This Memorandum of Understanding between UNWTO and FAO emphasises the cross-cutting nature of tourism and the importance of cooperation at every level to ensure the sector works for everyone. Both tourism and agriculture are lifelines for communities around the world. The agreement is particularly timely as it comes as we recognize 2020 as the year of Tourism for Rural Development. This was also the theme of World Tourism Day, which we celebrated this week, highlighting the role tourism must play in providing opportunities for rural communities and driving social and economic recovery.\" Key priority areas of the new collaboration The accord established a five-year work plan between FAO and UNWTO which includes collaborative actions between  GIAHS programme, the Coalition of Fragile Ecosystems (COFE), and other initiatives to foster innovation and entrepreneurship, drive sustainable development and income diversification opportunities and strengthen livelihoods, with a focus on youth and women. The new agreement will also focus on development of pescatourism - a new type of tourism promoting sustainable fisheries by offering visitors to experience fishing activities first-hand. Through this unique partnership, the two institutions will support the development of solutions to facilitate access of local farmers and food producers to global markets, while creating new experiences, fostering networks and establishing public-private sector alliances. One of the strengths of the new agreement is its focus on knowledge dissemination and guidance to develop and manage sustainable tourism through promoting good practices, smart solutions and innovative methods and products in rural tourism while conserving traditional values. 1000 villages project During the meeting, the FAO Director-General invited UNWTO to join FAO in \"a very ambitious initiative\" which seeks to identify 1000 villages across the world to convert them into digital villages. He noted that this effort will be implemented in collaboration with Microsoft, IBM, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other partners. The FAO Director-General proposed to combine the strengths of both organizations: UNWTO‘s expertise in identifying the touristic advantages and value of these villages and FAO's knowledge of the agricultural products they can market through e-commerce. \"A successful implementation of this project can make digital villages and rural tourism engines for increased resilience by diversifying incomes of farmers and for building back better in light of the COVID-19 pandemic\", Qu said. The Director- General also invited UNWTO to support the FAO  Hand-in-Hand Initiative. \n\n"},

A sustainable livestock sector will foster an inclusive economic growth, improve livelihoods, sustain animal health and welfare, and address environmental issues, he added.   This is the first virtual COAG - bringing together over 120 Member Nations, partners and the public in an open online session. For this year's session, the central theme is Sustainable Livestock for SDGs. In his address to members of the Committee, representatives of United Nations and Specialized Agencies and other delegates, the FAO Director-General highlighted the need for a holistic and inclusive approach to livestock sector policies and technical actions that includes all stakeholders within the food system. In this respect, he stressed the vital role the private sector needs to play and the importance of strong partnerships with the sector. Noting that the combined impacts of COVID-19, its suppression measures and subsequent global recession would increase the burden for family farmers and most vulnerable people, the FAO Director-General highlighted the need for greater support and increased investment in knowledge, infrastructure and technology for sustainable agriculture.  \"Our assessment suggests that the pandemic may add up to 132 million people to the ranks of undernourished in the world in 2020. This would be disastrous, particularly in the context of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals\", Qu said calling for an integrated agri-food system approach that addresses food security, livelihoods and the management of natural resources in a comprehensive and effective way.  In addition to COVID-19, agricultural and food systems are under increasing pressure from other unprecedented threats, like climate change, affecting crop yields, reducing the diversity of crop and animal species, and increasing the incidence and spread of pest and diseases, the FAO chief said.   \"The people most vulnerable to climate shocks and natural hazards are the 2.5 billion small-scale farmers, herders, fishers and forest-dependent communities who derive their livelihoods from natural resources\", he noted. The FAO Director-General called on countries to step up efforts to tackle the root causes of hunger and malnutrition through transformative changes to the way we produce, distribute and consume food.  To achieve this, we need to transform food and agriculture systems, ensuring inclusiveness and equality; identify and implement innovative approaches and technologies in agriculture; shift to more sustainable and diversified production and consumption patterns; and improve governance, he said. \"The goal we want to reach together is well defined: A tomorrow that is free of hunger; through better production, better nutrition, and a better environment for a better life!\" the Director-General concluded. FAO is pressing on despite the pandemic Since the early days of the pandemic, FAO has focused on ensuring the continued delivery of its mandate while safeguarding the health and wellbeing of its employees. In July, the UN Agency presented the FAO COVID-19 Response and Recovery Program aimed at preventing a global food emergency during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, while working on medium- to long-term development responses for food security and nutrition.  On the normative side, the International Code of Conduct for the Sustainable Use and Management of Fertilizers and the Ten Elements of Agroecology were adopted by the FAO Conference; and the FAO Climate Change Strategy is being implemented. On the operational side, FAO continued to support its members in combatting plant pests and animal diseases that affect lives and livelihoods of millions of people such as the Desert Locust, a threat that remains a priority for FAO with the pandemic making activities on the ground more difficult.  Between January and August 2020, over 760 000 ha have been controlled across ten countries from the Horn of Africa to Yemen. In this area, control operations have averted the loss of an estimated 1.52 million tons of cereal in the region. This amount of grain is enough to feed 9.88 million people for an entire year and is valued at $456 million.  In some countries, including Ethiopia and Somalia, FAO and governments are currently fighting the second generation of a widespread desert locust surge. National governments continue to lead control and surveillance operations supported by FAO through the provision of pesticides, bio-pesticides, equipment, aircraft and training. FAO has also launched the Global Action for Fall Armyworm Control for a strong and coordinated response to the rapid spread of the Fall Armyworm at all levels. In addition, the UN agency is providing assistance for a Peste des Petits Ruminants-free world, and measures aimed at countering African swine fever and other major animal diseases.  About COAG 27 COAG meets every two years. During the COAG 27 Session, delegates will discuss, among other important items, sustainable livestock for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a main theme. The livestock sector plays a key role in sustainable agricultural development and contributes directly or indirectly to each of the 17 SDGs. COAG will also review the central role of food and agriculture for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and provide guidance on further strengthening FAO support to achieving these goals in the SDG Decade of Action.\n\n"},

It aims to increase understanding of what policy and research work is required and improve coordination (including of resource mobilization) and information sharing between partners. A new United Against Rabies Forum aims to accelerate progress towards the elimination of human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030. The disease continues to kill one person every nine minutes - almost half of them children.WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: \"We can only eliminate rabies in people if we do a better job of controlling it in dogs, and if we radically improve access to treatment and care - especially among the poor and marginalized groups who suffer the most from this horrible disease.\" FAO Director-General, QU Dongyu said: \"While the coronavirus pandemic poses unprecedented challenges to us all, we can and must turn disadvantage to advantage. We have an opportunity now to strengthen One Health collaboration and regional cooperation, particularly to improve animal health systems and surveillance. Collaborating on rabies is an excellent way to put those ideas into practice.\" OIE Director-General, Monique Eloit stressed the need for collaborative efforts against rabies:\"This is a disease we know how to beat, but there is no single solution. We have to work together, across human and animal health sectors and with affected communities. If we do, elimination is possible, and in the process, we will also be building stronger systems for the detection and control of other diseases.\"FAO, OIE and WHO are committed to operationalization of ‘One Health', which promotes a policy approach that connects human, animal and environmental health interventions. In the case of rabies, this means coordinated investment in mass dog vaccination as a public health initiative alongside, improved surveillance and data collection as well as community awareness raising and ensuring access to affordable rabies treatment for humans (post exposure prophylaxis or PEP). Up to 99 per cent of rabies cases in humans are caused by dog bites, and rabies control is seen as a ‘model' disease for improving zoonotic disease control more broadly. However, investment in dog vaccination, rabies monitoring and surveillance systems remains low in most countries where rabies occurs. Scientific research and field evidence show that mass dog vaccination campaigns that cover 70 per cent of the at-risk dog population can confer herd immunity against rabies and are the only real way to interrupt the disease's infectious cycle between animals and humans. This can sharply reduce human rabies deaths as a result.\n\n"},

Hunger has been on the rise for the past five years, and the COVID-19 pandemic is threatening the food and nutrition security of up to an additional 132 million of people. On top of that, we are faced with an ecosystem decline and the consequences of climate change.Yet, food continues to be lost and wasted. This year we have witnessed an increase in food loss and waste as a result of movement and transport restrictions due to the pandemic.COVID-19 aside, however, each year about 14 percent of the world's food is lost before even reaching the market. Food loss is valued at $400 billion annually - about the GDP of Austria. On top of this comes food waste, for which new estimates are coming out early 2021. When it comes to environmental impact, food loss and waste generate eight percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.Food loss occurs from farm up to and excluding retail, whilst food waste occurs at retail, food service and household level. Causes range from poor handling, inadequate transport or storage, lack of cold chain capacity, extreme weather conditions to cosmetic standards, and a lack of planning and cooking skills among consumers.Simply put, reducing food lost or wasted means more food for all, less greenhouse gas emissions, less pressure on the environment, and increased productivity and economic growth.  Innovation, technologies and behavioral change - key to reducing food loss and waste\"Food loss and waste is a big challenge of our time,\" said FAO Director-General QU Dongyu, urging for stronger partnerships, more public and private investments in training for smallholder farmers, technology and innovation to step up the fight against food loss and waste as \"our planet is a small boat in the universe\".\"Innovative postharvest treatment, digital agriculture and food systems and re-modelling market channels offer huge potential to tackle the challenges of food loss and waste. We have just built a partnership with IBM, Microsoft and the Vatican to empower Artificial Intelligence in all these areas,\" added Qu.Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP, encouraged governments to make food loss and waste part of national climate strategies.\"Only 11 countries have so far included food loss in their Nationally Determined Contributions. None of them included food waste. By including food loss and waste and sustainable diets in revised climate plans, policymakers can improve their mitigation and adaptation from food systems by as much as 25 percent,\" said Andersen.Calling food loss and waste \"an ethical outrage\" given that so many people go hungry, António Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General, in a message sent in support of the Day, urged everyone to play their part in tackling this issue - from countries setting a reduction target and measuring their food loss and waste and policy action in this area being included in climate plans under the Paris Agreement to businesses taking a similar approach and individuals shopping carefully, storing food correctly, and using leftovers.The need for everyone to come together and step up efforts to reduce food loss and waste, including through innovation, technologies and education, to shift behavioural norms away from waste, to measure and track progress, as well as work towards increasing the availability of food and reducing the environmental footprint of agricultural production - topics to be explored in depth at the 2021 Food System Summit - were echoed by speakers and panel discussion participants from the UN, European Commission, private and public sectors, agriculture ministries of developing and developed countries, farmers', markets' and consumers' organisations and associations, academia and chefs.Solutions to reduce food loss and wasteSolutions to stem food loss and waste include: good data to know where in the value chain the major hot spots of food loss and waste are; applying innovation - for example, e-commerce platforms for marketing or retractable mobile food processing systems; government incentives to bolster private sector food loss and waste action and collaboration across supply chains; investments in training, technology and innovation, including for small-scale producers; better food packaging and relaxing on regulations and standards on aesthetic requirements for fruit and vegetables; behaviours that value and make the most of food at home; redistributing safe surplus food to those in need through food banks; facilitating farmer's access to consumers and shorter value chains through farmers markets and rural urban linkages; and investing more to strengthen infrastructure and logistics, including sustainable cold chains and cooling technologies.In many countries a large proportion of produce is lost during transportation. To address this, FAO has introduced improved, sustainable bulk packaging (in the form of stackable and nestable plastic crates), along with good post-harvest management practice, to transport fresh produce in a number of Southern and South-eastern Asian countries. The use of crates during transport has reduced losses of vegetables and fruits by up to 87 percent. Where crates replaced single-use plastic bags, this has also brought environmental benefits. (Source SOFA 2019, p. 36)UNEP, together with high-level coalition Champions 12.3, has developed a Target-Measure-Act approach to food loss and waste reduction. The United Kingdom, a pioneer of this approach, has achieved a 27 percent reduction in post-farm gate food loss and waste per capita by 2018 relative to its 2007 baseline, making it the first country in the world to have advanced more than halfway towards the achievement of SDG 12.3. Good data has helped the UK to make the case for action, together with an effective public-private partnership to facilitate cross supply chain collaboration, leveraging innovation in food promotion, labeling, and design, and a long-standing public behaviour change campaign, with re-doubled efforts and impacts on household food behaviours during the global pandemic. Several companies including Tesco (Central Europe), Campbell, and Arla Foods have achieved food loss and waste reductions of more than 25 percent-suggesting that achieving the target is possible for companies, too.A new African Centre of Excellence for sustainable cooling and cold chain based in Rwanda is helping get farmers' produce to market quickly and efficiently - reducing food waste, boosting profits and creating jobs.Elsewhere, young entrepreneurs like Isaac Sesi - who spoke at the event - also fight food loss with innovation. Sesi and the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for the Reduction of Post-Harvest Loss at Kansas State University are providing farmers in Ghana - Isaac's home country - with an affordable moisture meter called GrainMate, which measures the moisture content of maize and other grains, helping farmers ensure the grains are sufficiently dried and tackle the main cause of post-harvest loss in grain - insufficient drying before storage, which creates conditions for fungal growth, contamination and insect infestation.Food loss and waste - facts and figures In terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the food that is lost is associated with around 1.5 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent every year. UNEP will publish new country level food waste estimates at retail, food service and household level in its Food Waste Index report, early in 2021, and a common methodology for food waste measurement at national level on World Food Day, October 16th 2020. Studies commissioned by FAO before the pandemic estimate that on-farm losses in sub-Saharan Africa for fruits and vegetables are up to 50 percent, the highest in the world. For cereals and pulses, the on-farm losses are up to 18 percent, equal highest in the world with parts of Asia. Reducing food loss early in the supply chain - on the farm - in countries with high levels of food insecurity is likely to yield the strongest positive result for greater food security. Many countries deal with the growing demand for food by increasing agricultural production without reducing food loss and waste, and, thereby, exacerbating pressure on the environment and increasingly scarce natural resources.More about the eventThe marking of the Day - under the slogan Stop food loss and waste. For the people. For the planet - took place during the 75th session of the UN General Assembly.The event was hosted by FAO and UNEP - the agencies leading global efforts on food loss and waste reduction together with Andorra, Argentina and San Marino who were instrumental in establishing the international day through a UN General Assembly resolution adopted unanimously last year.Keynote speakers included: Luis Basterra, Argentina's Minister of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries; Maria Ubach Font, Andorra's Minister of Foreign Affairs; Luca Beccari, San Marino's Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Economic Cooperation and Telecommunications; Bekir Pakdemirli, Turkey's Minister of Agriculture and Forestry; Stella Kyriakides, European Commissioner, Health and Food Safety; Gilbert F.

The State of Agricultural Commodity Markets, 2020 (SOCO 2020) argues that global trade and well-functioning markets lie at the heart of the development process as they can spur inclusive economic growth and sustainable development, and strengthen resilience to shocks.  \"We need to rely on markets as an integral part of the global food system. This is all the more important in the face of major disruptions, whether they come from COVID-19, locust outbreaks or climate change,\" wrote FAO Director-General QU Dongyu in his introduction to the report.   The rise of global agri-food value chains The report estimates that about one-third of global agricultural and food exports are traded within a global value chain and cross borders at least twice. The rise of global value chains is driven by income growth, lower trade barriers and technological advancements, which have transformed markets and trade processes, linking farmers to traders and consumers across regions and countries. \"Global value chains can make it easier for developing countries to integrate into global markets. As they link our food markets closely, they also provide a mechanism to diffuse best practices to promote sustainable development,\" said the FAO Director-General. In turn, by participating in global value chains, smallholder farmers can boost their food production and income. On average and in the short term, a 10 percent increase in agriculture's global value chain participation can result in an increase of around 1.2 percent in labour productivity, finds the report.  Smallholder farmers, however, are often missing out on the benefits of global value chains. Furthermore, the emergence of global value chains with the stringent food quality and safety requirements could further marginalize smallholders. \"We need to redouble efforts to include smallholder farmers in modern food value chains, thus securing rural incomes and food security in both rural and urban areas,\" said Qu. To achieve this, there is a need for broad policies to create an environment that enables markets to flourish and bolsters smallholders' participation in global value chains - for example, better rural infrastructure and services, education and productive technology.  Digital technologies can help markets to function better and can improve farmers' access to them. Innovations, such as food e-commerce, can benefit both farmers and consumers. However, to guarantee that the dividends of digital innovation are shared with the poorest, the current digital divide in agriculture needs to be reduced. The adoption of more inclusive business models, such as contract farming and blockchains, can also help farmers to better integrate into modern and more complex value chains.  For example, participation in contract farming can increase farm income by more than half - based on an analysis of main studies on contract farming. The report underlines, however, the overall lack of information on the different impacts of contract farming, apart from its impact on farmers' welfare. How can agricultural and food markets foster sustainable development? The report makes the case for the role agri-food markets can play in fostering sustainable development. It argues that the promotion and wider application of voluntary sustainability certification schemes and standards in agriculture, for example, can address trade‑offs between economic, environmental and social objectives. Sustainability certification schemes can promote fair trade, inclusion, non‑discrimination, and environmentally-friendly farm practices. They also can ensure occupational safety, ban child labour, and encourage investments. For instance, according to data from smallholder coffee farmers in Uganda, sustainability-certified families spend 146 percent more on child education and keep children at school longer than non‑certified families. Another study on certification schemes that promote sustainable forests show that the production of forest shade-grown coffee in Ethiopia can help alleviate forest degradation. The report also points out that whilst bananas are one of the most traded tropical commodities in the world, only an estimated 5-8 percent are covered under sustainability standards. The evolution of trade and markets - trends and drivers International agri-food trade has been driven by: technological progress; urbanization; population and income growths; lower transport costs; trade policies and a decline in average import tariffs.  Upper and lower middle‐income countries together have increased their share in global agri‐food exports from about 25 percent in 2001 to 36 percent in 2018.  Whilst global agri-food trade has doubled since 1995 in real value, its growth rate has been slower since the 2008 financial crisis. This is expected to be further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2008 financial crisis and consequent economic slowdown stalled the evolution of agri-food global value chains, and the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt their potential in global trade and growth.  Digital technologies are transforming all stages of the food value chain - from farm to table. They improve efficiency, create jobs and save resources. But it is difficult to foresee all the impacts technological innovation can have on how we grow, process, trade and consume food.  While countries in Europe and Central Asia, and East Asia and the Pacific tend to trade within the same regions, countries in South Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, sub‑Saharan Africa, North America, and the Middle East and North Africa trade more globally. About 90percent of exports in agricultural commodities from sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean are destined for other regions. Trade will continue to play an important role in global food security and nutrition, by moving food from surplus to deficit regions.  Regional trade agreements can stimulate global value chain participation and spur institutional and policy reform. However, as many vulnerable countries continue to rely on global markets, the promotion of the multilateral trading system is important. The larger part of agri‑food trade is made up of processed food products. About SOCO 2020 The report covers four areas: trends in agricultural and food markets; global value chains in food and agriculture; farmers and value chains - business models more sustainable growth; digital technologies and agricultural and food markets.The SOCO 2020 report was launched at a virtual event today with the participation of Director-General Qu Dongyu; the United States Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue; the Minister for Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development of South Africa, Thoko Didiza; the Parliamentary State Secretary of Germany’s Ministry for Food and Agriculture, Hans-Joachim Fuchtel; the Chairperson of the FAO Committee on Commodity Problems, Gustaf Daud Sirait; the Deputy Director-General of the World Trade Organization, Alan Wolff; and the Undersecretary for Agriculture and Rural Development of Mexico, Miguel Garcia Winder.Speakers highlighted how the COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of ensuring the flow of food supply chains at global, regional and local levels. They agreed that food trade is a critical tool for development and economic growth, and that innovation and digitalization offer new opportunities to increase market activity and facilitate integration of smallholder farmers into modern and more complex value chains.The meeting was also attended by representatives from Canada, Sri Lanka, the European Commission and the University of Bocconi (Italy).

The Director-General opened the 43rd session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the United Nations body established by FAO and the World Health Organization (WHO) to protect consumer health and ensure fair practices in international food trade.  \"Especially in the time of COVID-19, the world needs the international Codex standards that allow us to keep our food traveling safely across borders,'' QU stressed. ‘'The last thing we need, in this already fragile situation, is an outbreak of a food borne disease.‘' In this context, the Director-General congratulated the Commission on how it has coped with the COVID-19 pandemic, producing guidance for governments, the food industry and consumers together with experts from FAO and WHO.  In his speech, the Director-General also emphasised the importance of working together with Members, international organizations, civil society and the private sector to strengthen Codex. He noted that Codex standards and guidelines should always evolve to be more efficient, effective and tangible for farmers and consumers, as well as provide valuable guidance for governments and the food industry. He also praised Codex's commitment to develop their work based on science and evidence and encouraged the Commission \"to explore the power of innovation and digital technology to continue your important work,\" highlighting that Codex standards require a steady flow of real time data and information.  ‘'As the pandemic evolves, we must ensure that trade continues to flow smoothly to contribute to food security and nutrition globally,'' Qu said. As examples of FAO's recent modernization, the Director-General cited FAO's Hand-in-Hand initiative and the proposed International Platform for Digital Food and Agriculture - an inclusive multi-stakeholder forum for identifying and discussing the potential benefits and risks of digitalization in the food and agricultural sectors. ‘'Digitalization is one area where FAO is well ahead of the curve and we are working relentlessly to harness the potential of modern technology for all those involved in food and agriculture,'' he noted. Furthermore, the Director-General reinforced FAO's commitment to strengthen the work of Codex: \"One of my first decisions in FAO was to allocate more funds to the FAO/WHO Scientific Advice Programme, which is the basis for Codex standards. That work is imperative and without it, Codex would be imparied we cannot let that happen.\" Qu also gave the example of his home country China to highlight how \"prioritizing Codex activities locally allows countries to build national systems and provides them a voice on the global stage.\" The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also noted how the pandemic  had highlighted the fragile links between the health of humans, animals and the planet.  He emphasized the importance of collaborating with FAO on improving food safety standards and support.  Background Established in 1963 by FAO and WHO, the Codex Alimentarius Commission has 189 Members and 237 Observers. It meets annually to adopt food safety and quality standards and related recommendations. The current session is being held virtually for the first time from 24 to 26 September 2020 and on 12 and 19 October 2020.  The virtual meeting will include decisions on General Principles of Food Hygiene; A Code of Practice on food allergen management and food standards for garlic, kiwifruit, cassava-based products, mixed zaatar, chili sauce and kava. It will also consider guidelines for supporting the development of harmonized food laws in Africa and others on the safe use and reuse of water in food production.  \n\n"},

The aim of the online event: AI, Food for All. Dialogue and Experiences is to reinforce and build upon the Rome Call for AI Ethics endorsed by Pope Francis and co-signed by FAO, IBM and Microsoft at a conference hosted by the Academy in February.  Today's discussions also focused on concrete ways through which AI can contribute to achieving the goal of feeding an estimated global population of nearly 10 billion by 2050, and to do this while safeguarding natural resources and addressing challenges such as climate change and the impacts of shocks including COVID-19. Examples of best practices in the use of AI and digital technology in agriculture, and which are openly accessible in the form of digital public goods, were also presented. \"The implementation of clearly Western technologies in food production and food processing significantly affects the food cultures of the populations of the Earth. We must feed everyone, but not everyone must necessarily eat the same things,\" said Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, President of the Pontifical Academy for Life. The protection of biological diversity (human, plant, animal diversity) must be the focus of our attention and must guide the whole process, from the design phases (ethics by design) to the way in which these are proposed and spread in different social and cultural contexts,\" he added. \"Transforming our food systems requires innovative solutions to ensure food security and nutrition for all,\" said FAO Director-General QU Dongyu. \"At FAO, together with the development of AI tools, we work towards establishing the International Platform for Digital Food and Agriculture - an inclusive multi-stakeholder forum for identifying and discussing the potential benefits and risks of digitalization of the food and agricultural sectors. For this aspect we really appreciate and expect colleagues from the AI and digital giants to offer us assistance, cooperation and engagement to help the (FAO) member countries and the farmers,\" he added. \"As society has grappled with an alarming public health emergency, uses of technology in response to COVID-19 have only underscored why the Rome Call for AI Ethics and its underlying principles are so critical to humanity's future,\" said John E. Kelly, III, IBM's Executive Vice President. \"Only by putting people, their interests and their values at the center of our thinking about the future of technology can we all emerge stronger from global challenges such as the pandemic and food security.\" \"At Microsoft, we believe technology can help unlock solutions for some of the world's biggest challenges,\" said Microsoft President Brad Smith. \"Technologies such as AI and Machine Learning tools will be particularly helpful as we work to address worldwide hunger and food insecurity issues, especially in a world grappling with climate change. These tools can forecast issues and respond with critical resources that help prevent future famines and save lives.\"  AI in agriculture, a crucial opportunity to achieve sustainable development  Artificial Intelligence has an important role to play in transforming food systems and helping to address food and nutrition insecurity. In the agricultural sectors, it can do so in several ways, including optimizing or even carrying out some human activities, such as planting and harvesting, thus increasing productivity, improving working conditions - by reducing the amount of time and toil - and using natural resources more efficiently, including through better knowledge management and planning.  In particular, as e-agriculture technology advances rapidly, AI in farming is emerging in three major areas: agricultural robotics, soil and crop monitoring, and predictive analytics. Progress in these areas can, in the context of climate change, population growth and depleting natural resources, contribute greatly to soil and water conservation which are increasingly key to achieving food security in a sustainable way.  At today's event, two examples of best practices in the use of AI in agriculture were presented:   FAO's WaPOR portal which monitors and reports on agriculture water productivity over Africa and the Near East. It provides open access to the water productivity database and its thousands of underlying map layers, and also allows for direct data queries, time series analyses, area statistics and data download of key variables associated to water and land productivity assessments;  The Agricultural Stress Index System (ASIS) is a quick-look indicator developed by FAO for the early monitoring of agricultural areas with a high likelihood of water stress/drought at global, regional and country level, using satellite technology. Drought affects more people than any other type of natural disaster and is the most damaging to livelihoods, especially in developing countries. Putting people, including farmers, at the centre The Rome Call for AI Ethics stresses that \"AI systems must be conceived, designed and implemented to serve and protect human beings and the environment in which they live,\" a concept that many participants at today's event reiterated. Underpinning the Rome Call are several key principles including: transparency, in that AI systems must be explainable; inclusion, so that the needs of all human beings are taken into account and they are offered the best possible conditions to express themselves and develop; and impartiality, so that such technologies do not create or act according to bias, to the advantage of just a few.  In relation to these principles, and in the context of the use of AI in agriculture, the partners and co-signatories to the Rome Call recognize the need to protect the rights of farmers and the knowledge that they possess, particularly those in developing countries. There is also a need to bridge the digital divide - 6 billion people are without broadband today, 4 billion without internet, 2 billion without mobile phones and 400 million people are without a digital signal and there are also significant gaps in access to resources between men and women, young and old. The partners to the Rome Call have urged countries and the public sector, to take advantage of the opportunities presented by AI to support small-scale farmers and enhance rural development, poverty eradication and improvement of food security. To do so they should invest in human capital and put in place policies and regulations that minimize the risk of exclusion and inequality.\n\n"},

Standard for fermented cooked cassava-based products ADOPTED- 24.09.2020 Cassava balls or sticks are obtained from fresh cassava roots, peeled, cut, soaked in water for fermentation, pressed and dried before packaging and cooking. Cassava is common in African diets and makes up 40 percent of the roots and tubers market. This standard will contribute to the regularization of the sector making it possible to define the identity and quality characteristics of fermented cassava products. Standard for fresh leaves of Gnetum spp. ADOPTED- 24.09.2020 The leaves of Gnetum spp, a wild evergreen climber found in the rain forests, are commonly known and consumed as eru, okok, fumbua and okasi. Countries will be able to regulate the sale and export of these products by basing their national legislation on this standard that establishes the characteristics and expected quality of the product. New work: Guidelines for supporting the development of harmonized food laws in Africa ADOPTED- 25.09.2020 The food trade is expected to increase throughout the region now that the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has come into force and will support countries, often with different legal systems, in incorporating the key principles underpinning food control into national food laws in the manner most appropriate for each specific country. This will contribute to the harmonization of sanitary and phytosanitary measures and to the restriction of discriminatory treatment in trade relations.   Regional standard for kava products for use as a beverage when mixed with water ADOPTED- 25.09.2020 Kava is part of both the culture and the economy of the Pacific Islands. The root of the kava plant, native to the region, is used to prepare a traditional drink and the regional standard for kava products for use as a beverage when mixed with water will facilitate fair trade practices and strengthen local economies. Pacific Island countries partnered with experienced Codex Members in the region to develop the text of the standard.  New work: Regional standard for soybean products fermented with Bacillus species ADOPTED- 25.09.2020 Natto, Cheonggukjang, Douchi, Kinema and Thua nao sa are traditional products fermented with Bacillus spp produced and mainly traded in Asia. Natto,for example, is produced in Japan by fermenting steamed soybeans with the bacterium Bacillus subtilis var. natto and by subsequent aging in cold or freezing conditions. Containing a variety of nutrients such as high-quality protein, vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber, Natto is widely recognized as a healthy food.  New work: Regional standard for quick frozen dumpling ADOPTED- 25.09.2020 Quick frozen food is a rapidly growing industry with sales in China alone of USD 4.8 billion in 2018. The dumplings, with their unique taste and high nutritional value, are made of dough and can be filled with meat, seafood, eggs, nuts or vegetables. The regional standard will establish the specifications, processing procedures, hygiene and labelling requirements for the product to bring consistency across the region, improve product safety and quality and ensure a level playing field for trade. New work: Regional standard for cooked rice wrapped in plant leaves ADOPTED- 25.09.2020 This product, widely consumed under a variety of names in countries such as China, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam, is made of glutinous or other rice as the main raw material: with or without adding ingredients such as beans, nuts, meat, poultry and eggs as filling. It is completely wrapped and moulded with various types of leaves and tied with cotton threads. After being steamed and cooked, the product may be vacuum packaged and quick frozen. A lack of a standard for these products can lead to obstacles in trade, therefore with production and sales on the increase, work to ensure uniformity in cooked rice products in the region is timely Standard for kiwifruit ADOPTED- 25.09.2020 Worldwide kiwifruit production and trade is growing and becoming increasingly valuable. This standard defines quality for kiwifruit including minimum requirements, classifications, sizing and quality tolerances. The standard will be a reference point for kiwifruit and facilitate fair practices in trade. Standard for fresh garlic ADOPTED- 25.09.2020 Fresh garlic is one of the most popular culinary species around the world. The standard defines three classes based on quality and presentation. For example, for class II garlic, there should be no more than three cloves, or one fifth of the total number of cloves in a bulb missing: whereas for “Extra” class and class I garlic, the cloves must be compact or reasonably compact.   Standard for ware potatoes ADOPTED- 25.09.2020 This standard defines the quality requirements for ware potatoes at the export-control stage after preparation and packaging. Ware potato comes in different varieties, sizes and colour and production and trade are increasing worldwide. Generally, size is the only criteria taken into consideration, therefore this standard will help enhance trade as it identifies common quality factors which can be harmonized across regions.  Standard for yam ADOPTED- 25.09.2020 Yam originates from Southeast Asia and Melanesia,and is exported to other regions such as the Americas, Africa, the rest of Asia, and Australia. Yam as a tuber is sensitive to physiological and physical damage, bruising, and cold conditions. The standard establishes the basic quality requirements for yam and establishes a benchmark for marketing yam globally.  Code of practice on food allergen management for food business operators ADOPTED- 25.09.2020 This code provides guidance on allergen management in food production, including controls to prevent cross-contact where an allergen is inadvertently transferred from a food containing an allergen to a food that does not contain the allergen. Its publication comes amidst growing concerns regarding the serious nature of food allergies and their health consequences, and the increasing complexity of the food supply chain. The code will facilitate a proactive approach to managing allergens in food production, rather than a reactive response once a food safety hazard has been identified. It supplements the newly adopted revised General Principles of Food Hygiene and the ongoing work on allergen labelling by the Codex Committee on Food Labelling.   Revision of the General Principles of Food Hygiene  ADOPTED- 25.09.2020 This code of practice provides a common ground for the control of food safety worldwide and forms the basis for all other Codex hygiene texts and standards. The revision includes updates which will enable better application by food business operators, competent authorities and other stakeholders. The code also provides more guidance on the important health issue of allergens which complements the adoption of a new Codex code of practice on allergen management. This revision helps countries maintain a continued safe supply of food at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to reinforce good hygiene practices.  New work: Guidelines for the safe use and reuse of water in food production ADOPTED- 25.09.2020 This work will develop guidelines for the safe sourcing, use and reuse of water that comes into direct or indirect contact with food throughout the food chain. It will address the concept of water that is “fit for purpose” - as opposed to water of potable or drinking water quality - by applying a risk-based approach. The new text will consider the use of water along the food chain in context and it is also a response to the impact of climate change and the need to re-use or recycle water. Food business operators will benefit from practical guidance and tools to help them understand the risks and available interventions. The work should be completed in 2023.  Regional standard for mixed zaatar ADOPTED- 25.09.2020 This standard determines the requirements and characteristics for mixed zaatar, (a combination of raw and broadleaf thyme and the husk of sumac and sesame seeds, to which other ingredients may be added) intended for direct human consumption and used in many food preparations such as Lebanese mankoushe and other specialties of the Near East region.  New work: Regional standard for maamoul ADOPTED- 25.09.2020 Maamoul is a filled pastry or cookie type of food product, widely consumed in countries of the Near East region, prepared mainly from wheat flour, semolina, wheat germ, food salt, butter and water and  filled with a sweet chewy paste based on dates or other fruits. This type of product is a highly nutrient-dense food due to this filling, butter and dough. A regional standard will provide guidance to the Maamoul production industry on the preparation of Maamoul and facilitate trade.  Standards for Chili sauce and Gochujang ADOPTED- 12.10.2020  The regional Codex standards for Chili sauce and Gochujang were developed in 2011 and 2009 respectively. These products are increasingly being consumed and distributed globally hence this conversion to a worldwide standard.   Revision to the Standard for Mango Chutney ADOPTED- 12.10.2020   The Codex Standard for Mango Chutney (CXS 160-1987) was developed almost 30 years ago. Since then a lot of developments have taken place regarding choice of ingredients and additives: processing techniques: quality parameters including identification of defects: colour and flavor, as well as the food safety parameters. The revision is in line with current production and marketing practices and now conforms to the current layout of Codex standards.  Standard for dried fruits ADOPTED- 12.10.2020  Dried fruits are produced and consumed in most regions of the world. Dried tropical fruits from developing countries are exported worldwide and the consumption of freeze-dried berries is likely to increase. Due to growing worldwide consumption, production and trade and the innovation of drying technology, Codex has developed an international standard for dried fruits to cover existing standards and new products.  Standard for canned mixed fruits ADOPTED- 12.10.2020   Fruits are important for a healthy diet and canned fruits provide a good way to enjoy tasty and nutritious fruits any time of year. There is growing interest amongst consumers for different combinations of mixed fruits and while some varieties of canned mixed fruits are currently available in international trade, this comprehensive horizontal standard will cover new combinations of mixed fruits by describing the required essential quality, hygiene and labelling requirements of the products.  New work: Proposal for the amendment of the Standard for Canned Sardines and Sardine-Type Products (CXS 94- 1981): inclusion of Sardinella lemuru (Bali Sardinella) in the list of Sardinella species under sec. 2.1 ADOPTED- 12.10.2020   This amendment will provide Member Countries and the sardine canning industry with a revised list of sardine-type fishes authorized for the preparation of sardine and sardine-type products including Sardinella lemuru or Bali Sardinella. \n\n"},

The commemorative event and the virtual conference are hosted by Canada in Quebec City, where FAO, conceived in the United States of America in 1943, was formally founded in 1945. The FAO Director-General emphasized the significant roles that Canada and the U.S. have played in FAO's mission over the last 75 years. Canada has worked with FAO \"towards finding solutions to the most pressing issues of our time and finding new ways of delivering support to those in need\", while the U.S., FAO's largest contributor, \"is a key partner, collaborating across all our areas of work, from global food trade and safety, to disaster assistance and resilience building to advancing science and innovation for taking global agriculture forward,\" Qu said.With the threat of a global food crisis looming today as in the aftermath of World War II, \"clearly the world needs the FAO, now more than ever,\" said Marie-Claude Bibeau, Canada's Minister of Agriculture  and Agri Food. \"Our shared purpose from the FAO constitution in 1945 is still enduring,\" said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. He noted that improving agricultural productivity has been critical in the dramatic reduction in global poverty. \"Thanks to the progress made through FAO and technology, we are now more connected as a global community than ever before. Globally everybody is more prosperous than at FAO's founding.\"\"Amid the pandemic, unity and cooperation are critical to carrying out appropriate actions,\" said Nadine Girault, Québec's Minister of International Relations and La Francophonie. \"I wish to underscore FAO's leadership in recent months and congratulate its leaders for the efforts deployed to combat the threat of food crises.\"\"Our mission is not yet accomplished,\" Director-General QU Dongyu said at a virtual event celebrating FAO's 75th anniversary ahead of the plenary meeting of the conference.Noting that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to raise the ranks of the world's hungry, which has already been creeping up in recent years, he added: \"Now, more than ever before, is the time for all of us to come together and ensure deliverance from hunger and malnutrition, especially for marginalized and vulnerable populations.\"He also outlined the Organization's approach moving forward, including FAO's COVID-19 Response and Recovery Plan and the Hand-in-Hand Initiative, which places emphasis on areas particularly affected by hunger and poverty and which is driven by state-of-the-art technologies including its own Geospatial Platform.

Qu noted, however, that Latin American and Caribbean countries need to strengthen their efforts as COVID-19 continues its rampage, mainly affecting the poorest and most vulnerable people. \"Over 34 million jobs have been lost is this region, and the UN projects that up to 28 million people could fall into extreme poverty, which means a high likelihood of also suffering severe food insecurity,\" he said. In this context, Qu highlighted how FAO has been at the forefront of addressing the challenges posed by the pandemic through the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Program, aimed at preventing a global food emergency, while strengthening the resilience and inclusiveness of food systems and livelihoods. \"The Program enables donors to leverage the Organization's convening power, real-time data, early warning systems and technical expertise to direct support where and when it is needed most,\" he said. The Director-General also referred to the Hand-in-Hand Initiative as a new approach and platform to promote enhanced collaboration among national and local authorities, the private sector, civil society scientists, NGOs, and many others. \"It is a new business model for collaboration, which uses a broad spectrum of partnerships and leverages the technical and data capacity of the Organization, to determine the best options to reach the most vulnerable and have the greatest impact on poverty and hunger,\" he said. Qu noted that the region is a pillar of global food security and encompasses a very large share of the world's biodiversity, forests, water and productive soils and has pioneered important policies to eradicate poverty and reach zero hunger.  To unleash the region's full potential in terms of food and agriculture, the Director-General called on Members to promote innovation and digital technologies; create new opportunities for rural people by taking advantage of the new demands of urban consumers; and expand trade and access to markets for farmers and agri-food entrepreneurs, through science-based and fair multilateral rules. The FAO Director-General also stressed that the UN agency is making profound changes to address the global challenges of food and agriculture. As an example, he mentioned the establishment of a dedicated Office for Small Island Developing States (SIDS), Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs) and noted that 18 of the 33 countries in the region belong to one or more of the aforementioned groups. Qu also spoke of the new FAO Office for Innovation and the Office of Climate Change, Biodiversity and Environment.  A historic Regional Conference  The first virtual Regional Conference in Latin America and the Caribbean kicked off with an unprecedented level of political support and participation. More than 50 ministers are registered to participate - including all the region's ministers of Agriculture - 40 vice-ministers and 360 other delegates, as well as observers from civil society, the private sector, the scientific and academic worlds, the Parliamentary Fronts against Hunger, and 37 sister organizations of the United Nations system and the inter-American system. Denis Moncada, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the host country Nicaragua, spoke on behalf of President Daniel Ortega and expressed the hope that the region's economies and agricultural sector make a fast recovery after the impact of the pandemic. The Chairman of the Conference and Minister for Agriculture of Nicaragua, Edward Centeno, highlighted the key role that the Regional Conference plays in the region's efforts towards the Sustainable Development Goals. Among high-level participants in the first day of debates, the Prime Minister of Haiti, Joseph Jouthe, praised FAO's assistance in supporting Haiti's food security and nutrition policies, and its climate change adaptation plan.  The First Lady of Colombia, Maria Juliana Ruiz, emphasized the need to drive innovation and technology to improve nutrition throughout the region, while ensuring the protection of its invaluable ecosystems.  The Vice-President of El Salvador, Félix Ulloa, highlighted the FAO Hand in Hand Initiative as a proactive response to the pandemic, and noted how El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has put forth an ambitious plan to reactivate the agricultural sector and boost Blue Growth with FAO's support. In his intervention, Khalid Mehboob, Independent Chairperson of the FAO Council, underscored how Latin America and the Caribbean was the first region to commit to completely eradicating hunger by 2025, and eight of its FAO member nations have managed to fully eradicate hunger. However, he also noted that the region has seen a rise in hunger in the past few years, with the number of undernourished increasing by 9 million between 2015 and 2019. For his part the FAO Regional Representative for Latin America and the Caribbean, Julio Berdegué, warned that: \"Agriculture must be sustainable or it will have no future.\" FAO, he noted, will strive to support the region's countries to make agriculture more sustainable and resilient, reducing its environmental footprint, and emissions of greenhouse gases. \"This change will be an engine of innovation, new investments, and new and better jobs\", he said. FAO Members in Latin America and the Caribbean meet every two years to discuss issues of common concern, define priorities and guide FAO's work in support to the region's food and agriculture.\n\n"},

The World Food and Agriculture - Statistical Yearbook 2020 offers a synthesis of the major factors at play in the current global food and agriculture landscape, including information ranging from farming trends, inputs use, labor utilization, food security and nutrition to greenhouse gas emissions and the impact of agriculture on the environment. FAO is a major provider of global data on agriculture and food security, in particular featuring the FAOSTAT portal tracking around 20 000 indicators covering 245 countries and territories, the Sustainable Development Goals Data Portal and the new Hand-in-Hand Geospatial Data platform, which harnesses innovation and a broad set of partners to identify actionable development projects.\"Now more than ever, timely, accurate and high-quality statistics are essential to monitor trends and inform policy decisions, whether concerning the longer-term challenge of delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), or the immediate threat represented by the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said José Rosero Moncayo, Director of FAO's Statistics Division. \"FAO is committed to ensuring free access to current, reliable and trusted data, as they provide the indispensable evidence base that countries require to formulate policy decisions and monitor progress towards agreed objectives.\"The Yearbook is divided into four thematic chapters focusing respectively on the economic dimensions of agriculture, forestry and fishing; production, trade and price trends; food security and nutrition; environmental sustainability. The Yearbook is accompanied by FAO's Statistical Pocketbook, which provides a quick and easy reference on the main facts and trends of food and agriculture.Key takeawaysAgriculture's global contribution to global gross domestic product increased by 68 percent between 2000 and 2018 to $3.4 trillion. Asia accounts for 63 percent of that total, while Africa is home to the fastest growth, almost twice the global pace. The number of people employed in agriculture has declined in this millennium, to 884 million or 27 percent of the global work force compared to 1 050 million or 40 percent in 2000. The bulk of that decline occurred in Asia, although the sharpest drop was observed in Europe, where only 5.3 percent of the employed population works in the sector, compared to 49 percent in Africa.  The Yearbook also notes that 37.1 percent of these workers are women, who account for more than half the national agricultural work force in 22 countries.Global pesticide use has increased by one-third to 4.1 million tonnes each year, although has been steady since 2012. China is the world's top user, deploying more than four times as much as Brazil and the United States of America. Worldwide fertilizer use has expanded to 53 million tonnes - about 121 kilograms per hectare of cropland - with nitrogen the dominant chemical and potassium accounting for the fastest growth rate. The fastest expansions have been in Africa and the Americas, although the former starts from a very low starting level. The production of primary crops was 9.2 billion tonnes in 2018, around 50 percent more than in 2000. Oil crops had the fastest growth, up 88 percent. Four crops account for half of global primary crop production: sugar cane, maize, wheat and rice.The data also show that the top producer of many of the chief food commodity crops accounts for a sizeable share of global output: Brazil for sugar cane, China for rice and potatoes, the U.S. for maize and soybeans. A similar story describes processed outputs, with China the leading soybean oil producer, Indonesia and Malaysia far and away the main palm oil producers, and Ukraine and Russia the main sunflower oil producers. Global food trade has grown even faster than output, with its total monetary value almost quadrupled to $1.4 trillion between 2000 and 2018.Hunger is on the rise, with almost 690 million people undernourished in 2019, close to 60 million more than in 2014. At the same time, obesity is also increasing: It affected 13.1 percent of the adult population in 2016, compared with 8.7 percent in 2000.Cropland increased by 75 million hectares between 2000 and 2017, equivalent to twice the size of Japan. Over the same period, forest land decreased by 89 million hectares, equivalent to size of Nigeria.World agriculture emissions within the farm gate grew by 16 percent between 2000 and 2017. About 60 percent come from livestock-related activities.The Yearbook offers granular data organized by country and subject, as well as a wealth of graphics and maps that make the data accessible. \n\n"},

Together. \"The present moment is again fraught with danger, complicated, and demands urgent action. As hunger grows once more, as the COVID-19 pandemic exposes the fragility of our food systems, history is calling upon us once more to rise to the challenge,\" urged Qu.The Director-General spoke today at FAO's global 75th Anniversary/World Food Day virtual event in Rome, which brought together Pope Francis; Italy's President; Lesotho's King and Spain's Queen - FAO Special Goodwill Ambassadors for Nutrition; UN's Secretary General; and the heads of IFAD and WFP.Saluting FAO's anniversary, Pope Francis described the organization's mission as \"beautiful and important\".Time to build back betterWorld Food Day is marked this year as global hunger rises for the fifth consecutive year and a healthy diet is out of reach for 3 billion people. Nearly 700 million people still go hungry, and the pandemic could tip up to 132 million more into hunger by the end of 2020.This year's World Food Day aims to galvanize and accelerate action towards ending hunger and malnutrition in all its forms, and to make food and agriculture an essential part of the COVID-19 response.Chief amongst them, as speakers at today's event noted, are global solidarity and building more resilient, robust agri-food systems that can withstand shocks, deliver affordable and sustainable healthy diets for all, and decent livelihoods for all workers along the food supply chain.  \"Now is the time to rethink our approaches and redouble our efforts,\" said Qu.Amongst these, Qu highlighted pioneering sciences and technologies, stressing that \"Innovation is our ally in re-imagining our food systems and ending hunger, as we are morally and politically bound to do in the next ten years\".Pope Francis urged for more support for FAO's and all UN food agencies' initiatives that promote sustainable and diversified agriculture, and support small farming communities and the rural development of the poorest countries.Using the money that buys arms and covers military expenses for defeating hunger and rural development instead would also be a \"courageous decision\", said the Pope.\"Hunger is not merely a disaster for humanity but also a disgrace... We cannot fail to respond or to act. We all are responsible,\" said Pope Francis.His words were echoed by UN's Secretary-General António Guterres who called for intensified efforts to achieve the vision of Sustainable Development Goals - \"a future where everyone everywhere has access to the nutrition they need\". To inspire action towards this vision, Guterres said, he will convene a Food Systems Summit next year.Noting that his country was proud to host FAO's headquarters, Italy's President Sergio Mattarella said he welcomed FAO's and its Director-General's \"commitment to work with Italy and many other countries in forging a \"food coalition\" aimed at containing the effects of COVID-19 on food systems\".This is the moment of \"crucial choices\", and of \"a serious global commitment,\" concluded Mattarella who expressed hope for the international community to rediscover a \"profound meaning of the valuable goods the earth offers us\" and the \"responsibility to share and safeguard them for future generations\".Healthy diets for allFAO Goodwill Ambassadors for Nutrition, King Letsie III of Lesotho and Queen Letizia of Spain stressed that healthy diets were everyone's right.King Letsie III underlined that most of the people who cannot afford a healthy diet live in Africa and Asia, and called for \"concerted efforts to bring down the cost of nutritious foods\" so more people can afford them.\"The nutritional status of the most vulnerable populations groups is likely to deteriorate further as a result of the destructive health and social economic impact of COVID-19,\" warned King Letsie III.Highlighting that hundreds of millions go hungry whilst many more suffer from obesity, Queen Letizia said: \"These imbalances should make us think about how to strengthen food systems, seeking shorter marketing pathways to encourage local, seasonal, sustainable and small-scale production, a strategy that would also make life easier for many women in regions of the world where their vulnerability is extreme.\"The president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development's (IFAD) Gilbert F. Houngbo said:\"We know that when crisis strikes, it is the poor and the vulnerable who suffer the most. We just cannot help but be aware of this reality and focus our attention on these most marginalized people, particularly in rural settings. At a time like this, these rural people need our support even more. But we also need them. If we want strong, healthy and peaceful societies, first we need to produce enough nutritious food for everyone.\"Ending wars and responding to climate extremes criticalThe World Food Programme (WFP) was last week awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize for Peace, which many speakers today lauded as a recognition of hunger as a threat to peace and the need for the international community to turn its attention to addressing food insecurity. David Beasley, Executive Director of WFP said:\"2021 is looking very bleak. But I believe that if we reached deep into the hearts and pockets of the people around the world, we can perform another miracle.\"\"But as long as we have man-made conflicts, we will never end hunger,\" warned Beasley. \"It is critical that we end the wars, it is critical that we respond to climate extremes...If we strengthen the fragile governments out there, do the things we know that we have the expertise to do, I believe that we will be celebrating World Food Day in a way we have never done before because hunger will be at the end.\"World Food Day events around the worldEarlier today, the FAO Director-General participated in an online World Food Day event in Brussels hosted by the European Parliamentary Alliance against Hunger and Malnutrition, whose continued efforts to put food and nutrition high on the political agenda, he commended. Qu was joined, amongst others, by the Vice-President of the European Parliament, Heidi Hautala, and the European Commissioner for Agriculture, Janusz Wojciechowski. Hautala called for globalized and systematic solutions, innovation and equity as part of efforts to build back better and end hunger. Wojciechowski spoke about EU's Green Deal and noted the Commission's COVID-19 response work with FAO on food security and rural development. Achieving Zero Hunger possibleThis renewed sense of commitment and call to action today is all the more important as a joint study of FAO and partners revealed this week that we could end hunger by 2030 if donors double their investments and spend the money wisely.\"The scourge of hunger has been tormenting humankind for millennia. But we are the generation that can end it, once and for all,\" said FAO Director-General.Honouring food heroesThis year's World Food Day also honours all food heroes, who - despite all difficulties - continue to provide food to their communities and beyond.Today, FAO and its partners are urging everyone to show gratitude for the food we eat and the people who produce, plant, harvest, fish or transport it.Events in over 150 countries, including at Rome's Colosseum that is serving as a stunning backdrop for an FAO video mapping show this evening, mark World Food Day and celebrate the world's food heroes and FAO's anniversary.\n\n"},

Italy's approach to international cooperation focuses on the link between humanitarian interventions and development and the goal of creating resilient and sustainable supply chains, said Fassino, hailing FAO's \"big role in enshrining the right to food in the laws of more than 30 countries.\"The COVID-19 Food Coalition presented in June by Italy aims to \"stand alongside FAO\" and create a \"network of best practices in the fight against food security\", said Gallinella. \"Food security should be a permanent priority and central to national recovery plans\" in the wake of the pandemic, he added, noting Italy's strong support for the Food Coalition.Some 40 countries have expressed interest in joining the coalition, including numerous members of the G-20, the Director-General said, noting that he has taken a strong personal role in promoting the plan and met with more than 100 potential partners. The Coalition, to be led by FAO, is a multi-stakeholder, multisectoral mechanism that aims to mobilize political, financial and technical assistance to tackle the medium and long-term adverse impacts of the pandemic on food systems and agriculture. The Coalition is a means to pursuing the transformation of the world's' agri-food systems to fit the \"new normal\", he added. FAO will officially launch the COVID-19 Food Coalition at a high-level event on 5 November 2020. Qu described it as a country-led and country-owned initiative with FAO taking charge of implementation and creating a platform for dialogue among diverse stakeholders to help countries achieve SDG-2 - ending hunger by 2030 - through global coordinated action. The pandemic has \"brought about a crisis of a magnitude without parallel in modern times\" and \"laid bare the fragility of our agri-food systems, the frailty of our food supply chain, the precarious nature of the agricultural labour force and the thin line that separates many families from poverty,\" the Director-General said. Lively debateNumerous Italian parliamentarians participated in today's session, with one - Valentino Valentini - insisting that that the Food Coalition and Hand-in-Hand Initiative should be part of a permanent ongoing  effort \"because in agriculture we go from crisis to crisis.\" Another, Maurizio Martina, a former agriculture minister, expressed his \"full support\" for the coalition and noted that collaboration between Italy and FAO had begun to intensify with the 2015 Milan Expo. The Director-General fielded a host of questions. He emphasized that since taking the helm in August 2019 he has sought to overhaul FAO to make it more dynamic, transparent, inclusive, digital, accountable, innovative and action- and results-oriented. Stressing the importance that the Organization be seen as giving significant returns to its Members, especially its host country, he called for robust feedback, which he termed essential for sustainable partnerships and positive synergies as well as enabling the Food Coalition to grow. Qu expressed optimism about the prospects for international collaboration, saying that the 20 countries that provide the most resources to FAO have all paid their membership fees on time and increased their voluntary contributions. On issues such as global food security - and worldwide parliamentary initiatives such as the Right to Food - multilateral cooperation is like a river that can't be stopped from reaching the sea, he said. He alluded to the fundamental contributions that agricultural innovation can make, citing the dramatic improvements in output and food security that were achieved in China since he was a child. On ItalyThe Director-General noted that Italy has a special status in the world of food and agriculture, with the Mediterranean diet, a family-farming base producing high-value outputs, a strong food-processing sector, powerful marketing skills and a cultural focus on healthy diets - all elements that are key to the sustainable transformation of agri-food systems that FAO is pursuing worldwide.  He called upon Italy to make wider use of digital technologies in food and agriculture -and participate in the International Platform for Digital Food and Agriculture, calling it key for rural development and noting that the post-pandemic landscape will almost certainly feature \"a more digital life\" for all. He also thanked Italy for the generous concession of its headquarters in central Rome - noting that recent World Food Day celebrations including a video mapping show on the Colosseum's walls were a  homage to Italy and its people - and invited parliamentarians to visit FAO headquarters to deepen the dialogue and partnership. \n\n"},

We must work together to minimize the impact that the pandemic will have on our food systems, livelihoods and health,\" the Director-General said. The importance of data collection and analysis for the development of a new generation of public policies and programmes was also highlighted by countries, as well as agreements and alliances between the public, private, scientific, academic and civil society sectors, to promote governance of food systems that enable healthy diets and sustainable food systems. In this context, countries supported the Hand-in-Hand Initiative to promote effective cooperation mechanisms between recipient and donor countries, as well as to mobilize resources from financial institutions and the private sector, particularly to reduce the development gaps that affect lagging rural territories in the region. The initiative is equipped with state-of-the-art tools - the Hand in Hand Geospatial Platform and the Data Lab for Statistical Innovation - to support countries and other stakeholders with data collection and analysis for decision-making and impact assessment. Transforming food systems towards better nutrition in the region  The Regional Conference held a special event organised by the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) to discuss ways to transform food systems and ensure healthy diets for all, entitled \"Driving Transformation Toward Sustainable Food Systems and Healthy Diets.\" The region of Latin America and the Caribbean is undergoing a rapid nutritional transition. Since 2014, hunger has grown again by 13 million people, and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to lead to an increase in the incidence of hunger. Today, almost 48 million people suffer from hunger in the region. At the same time, obesity levels are also on the rise affecting around 25 percent of the population. \"We need to join all our efforts and work together, now more than ever before\", said FAO Director-General QU Dongyu opening the special event. \"Because, we are not on track to eradicating hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition by 2030. And because the COVID-19 pandemic comes at a time when food insecurity was already increasing in the region\". He noted that the pandemic and the related containment measures are especially damaging for Small Island Developing States, which heavily depend on food imports, and called on the countries in the region to step up efforts to make their food systems more efficient, healthy and sustainable, stressing that agri-food systems transformation should be country-owned and country-led. For his part, the CFS Chairperson and Permanent Representative of Thailand to the Rome-based Agencies, Thanawat Tiensin, noted that the CFS Voluntary Guidelines on Food Systems and Nutrition are currently under negotiation by all CFS members and are expected to be adopted at the next CFS Plenary session in February 2021. He urged all stakeholders including governments, parliamentarians, private sector and civil society to improve cross-sectoral policy coordination and join efforts to turn policies into action. During the event, the FAO Director-General and the CFS Chairperson were joined by Senator Jorge Pizarro of Chile, President of the Parliament of Latin America and the Caribbean (PARLATINO); Marisa Macari, El Poder del Consumidor, Mexico, Representative of the CFS Civil Society Mechanism; and Maria Nelly Rivas, Cargill, Representative of the CFS Private Sector Mechanism, as well as regional policy-makers and experts.  The CFS was established in 1974, hosted by FAO, as an intergovernmental body to serve as a forum in the United Nations System for review and follow-up of policies concerning world food security. It is considered the most inclusive platform in the UN System. In his closing remarks to the Regional Conference, the Chairperson and Minister for Agriculture and Livestock of Nicaragua, Edward Centeno Gadea, highlighted the importance of FAO's work to support rural families, particularly the most vulnerable ones, and affirmed that \"fighting against poverty is an act of peace.\" More information about the Regional Conference for Latin America and the Caribbean can be found here.\n\n"},

In a stirring tribute to the UN agency and its work, the video mapping show celebrated food heroes and encouraged global solidarity efforts for the transformation of food systems. Until Sunday October 18, the show will continue to be screened on the facade of FAO's global headquarters in Viale Aventino.  \"Today, at this special moment, we celebrate FAO's 75th anniversary and commemorate the 40th anniversary of the World Food Day in a very special way,\" the Director-General said through a high-tech application in his cell phone that translated his words from Chinese into Italian. \"With the new era, new missions and new tasks before us, we will never give up until we reach our goals. Let us forge ahead hand-in-hand,\" he concluded.  The Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation of Italy, Emanuela Del Re (speaking on behalf of Minister Luigi Di Maio); the Minister for Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies of Italy, Teresa Bellanova; and the Mayor of Rome, Virginia Raggi, participated in the event with Khalid Mehboob, the Chairman of the Independent Council of FAO. They congratulated the Director-General on FAO's 75th anniversary and the contribution the Organization had made to fighting hunger, in particular with the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.   Vice-Minister Del Re noted there was \"a piece of Italy\" in the three UN organizations based in Rome and Italy stood with FAO in meeting its objectives to eradicate hunger. She stressed that today's event was being celebrated by Italians as well as the UN agency and drew attention to the recently-launched Food Coalition, an Italian proposed initiative led by FAO which aims to tackle the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on food and agriculture. Minister Bellanova highlighted that food security is an absolute priority, as well as the importance that Italy gives to the right to food. She said the Italian Government was working with its European partners for the promotion of sustainable agri-food systems and intended to include this subject on the agenda of the G20 when Italy assume its Presidency in 2021. Mayor Raggi said she was proud that Rome hosted the UN's three food agencies. She spoke of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public health and food systems around the world, emphasizing the importance of solidarity among people to face this challenging situation. The video mapping show has been made possible with the support and collaboration of the Italian government and the Rome Municipality. Video of the event can be accessed here.\n\n"},

The package will also help to strengthen the longer-term resilience of the food system, including production, processing and transport. It includes immediate technical and policy assistance as well as strategic inputs to support the transformation of food systems after the crisis. The initiative will look at investment options for urban food, low or zero carbon value chains and more efficient distribution systems, including e-marketing. Jean-Marc Peterschmitt, EBRD Managing Director, Industry, Commerce and Agribusiness, noted that the initiative complemented the €750 million in new loans the Bank had already committed to the agribusiness sector since the beginning of 2020. \"In addition to our regular support for investments in agribusiness,\" he explained, \"we have been active in providing short-term liquidity and working capital to the sector under the EBRD's Solidarity Package. With the assistance provided by FAO, we will also offer technical guidance to local agrifood companies in the economies where we invest, to help them bounce back faster and adapt to post-COVID-19 realities.\" Keeping agrifood chains flowing The pandemic has changed the way people buy and consume food. Fear of contagion has meant fewer visits to food outlets, with more people turning to e-commerce and online orders. The collapse in tourism has also put a big dent in the hospitality industry, altering the demand for certain food products. Agribusinesses and producers need to adapt to these evolving demands. At the same time, they need to adapt to new sanitary standards, labour shortages and logistics constraints. According to FAO Investment Centre Director Mohamed Manssouri, as companies adjust to COVID-19, digital technologies, the advanced use of big data, food safety, food traceability and a focus on local foods will become more prevalent. \"Our main goal is to make food systems work under COVID-19 and avoid any unnecessary disruptions to agrifood supply chains by enhancing market transparency and ensuring proper dialogue between private players and local authorities. We also need to help the sector accelerate its transformation towards more resilient and sustainable business models, including low or zero carbon options, more inclusive solutions and more diversified sourcing from global supply chains as well as shorter supply chains, when possible.\" Building resilience FAO and the EBRD are long-standing partners and responded to the coronavirus crisis with new initiatives. For example, they both stepped up their interactions with grain producers and traders in Serbia and Ukraine to establish operational protocols and develop practical recommendations for grain silo operations under COVID-19. Under the technical support package, the two institutions aim to help Tunisia's olive oil sector put all COVID-19 requirements in place for the 2020 harvest, while encouraging a shift towards higher value products for export, such as bottled olive oils. In Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, FAO and the EBRD will promote best practices to support the uptake of new technologies for more efficient livestock supply chains. In Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, Tajikistan and Ukraine, fruit and vegetable producers will receive support to enhance COVID-19 safety measures, increase real-time market information and share best practices for finding new marketing outlets, including B2B. In October 2020, FAO and the EBRD celebrate 23 years of working together towards more sustainable and inclusive food systems, combining much needed expertise and investment capacity.\n\n"},

He also noted his invited guest's lecture was held on International Day for Rural Women, who often have limited access to mobile phones- which he calls a \"new farming tool\". Emphasizing the importance of rural areas and smallholders, he urged that the \"development deficit\" between countries must not be replicated in a similar digital divide. Kremer discussed future prospects for digital agriculture, including the provision of higher-resolution weather information, customized pest-control advice, opportunities to improve supply chains and ways to improve extension services. Now a professor at the University of Chicago, he won the 2019 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel together with Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee in recognition of work that took experimental approaches to alleviating global poverty, including the innovative use of randomized control trials to answer key development questions related to agriculture, water, education and health. His personal and professional output also involves leading roles in organizations that promote precision agriculture, advanced market commitments to stimulate development and distribution of vaccines in the developing world, and private philanthropy to effective charities. Under Qu's leadership, FAO has accelerated promotion of digital agriculture and the use of smartphones to boost the productivity and livelihoods of the world's poorest - an effort that became even more critical due to the disruptions to the world's food systems - as well as work methods at FAO and other organizations - caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Highlights include the creation of an Office of Innovation headed by the  first ever FAO's Chief Scientist, the launch of the Hand-in-Hand geospatial data platform - which provides public, verified and impartial data as part of an initiative to bring more stakeholders into development efforts -  and an agreement backed by more than 70 agriculture ministers to establish an International Platform for Digital Food and Agriculture - which Qu invited Kremer to join. Ongoing FAO work uses mobile and digital technologies to help Members and farmers to combat invasive species and deforestation, optimize water management and land use patterns and spread knowledge on food safety standards and e-commerce opportunities.Professor Kremer noted FAO's leading role in investing in research into \"global public goods for the future.\"The Director-General said that Kremer's work - which elicited a lively question-and-answer session with Permanent Representatives, FAO directors, technical staff -  is \"close to our heart and mandate\" and highlighted the importance of understanding that \"farmer, agriculture and rural\", while interlinked, are three distinct issues articulated in local cultures.From results to impactsWhile open to the public and webcast on FAO's web site, Professor Kremer's virtual seminar was hosted by FAO's Impact Evaluation Task Force, set up last year with the aim of fast-tracking an agile culture of evaluation and improve the value-for-money proposition the Organization makes to Members and stakeholders as well as to partners in the United Nations system and beyond. The task force, which reports to FAO's Chief Economist Máximo Torero, aims to bolster within FAO - both across headquarter divisions and including regional, liaison and country offices - a culture of evaluation that moves beyond reporting on outputs and results towards an emphasis on impact and outcomes. The task force members organize impact evaluation clinics to analyze and assess actual projects and programmes, as well as a seminar series featuring guests such as Professor Kremer and other leading international experts. \n\n"},

The UN leaders renewed their commitment virtually at the Fourth Informal Joint Meeting of the FAO Council, the IFAD Executive Board and the WFP Executive Board. It was the first time the heads of the three UN Rome-based agencies (RBA) had met since WFP was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 2020 on Friday. FAO's Director-General congratulated WFP on the award, saying it not only recognized the efforts of generations of UN workers but also drew greater international attention to the importance of food insecurity and its linkages to conflict in the world. \"As we are marking FAO's 75th anniversary this week, more than ever, we need to continue the partnership the RBAs have forged and renew our energy to fight hunger and build a better world,\" Qu said, noting that \"the challenge to leave no-one behind and no land behind can only be addressed through collective action and partnership.\" WFP Executive Director Beasley described the Nobel Peace Prize as \"a call to action\" to make the world aware of what the UN agencies are confronting. He noted that the award had alerted the international community to the link between conflict and food insecurity and emphasised the significance of next year's Food Systems Summit in effecting change. \"Let it inspire us, encourage us, to do more and never give up,\" he said. The sentiment of pride and joy for WFP's award was shared by all participants, including IFAD's president; the Independent Chairperson of FAO's Council, Khalid Mehboob (chair of the meeting); the President of the Executive Board of WFP and Permanent Representative of Germany, Ulrich Seidenberger; the Special Envoy for the 2021 Food Systems Summit, Agnes Kalibata; Permanent Representatives of Members; as well as the UN Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, who addressed the meeting through a video message. RBA collaboration in the field The meeting discussed the status of joint RBA action plans and programmes at regional and country level. The FAO Director-General indicated that RBA collaboration had increased since the last informal joint meeting of the three boards in September 2019. \"Our most effective collaboration is happening at the country level: the number of joint RBA programmes has almost doubled since 2017 reaching more than 50 countries today,\" Qu said. \"That is what our Members expect from us: to move forward in concrete ways.\" Turning his attention to specific programmes, the Director-General detailed the Rome-based agencies' action to expand efforts in the Sahel region through a $180 million programme that is being developed, which is aimed at strengthening the resilience of populations vulnerable to COVID-19, conflicts and climate change.   He then alluded to the Canada-funded RBA Resilience Initiative in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Niger, and Somalia where the three agencies are collaborating to strengthen food security resilience and nutrition using an innovative approach that bridges humanitarian and development issues, with a particular focus on gender specific needs. The importance of working together was expressed by several speakers throughout the event. IFAD President Houngbo stressed the need to step up collaboration not only between the Rome-based agencies but with other UN agencies and institutions, depending on specific issues. The President of the Executive Board of WFP, Ulrich Seidenberger, noted that the world was facing an historical time of crisis and appreciated a greater focus at the RBA agencies' meeting on concrete and operational issues. He indicated that it was important to \"break down silos\" to strengthen the agencies' collective commitment and implement joint programmes. Members from all regions welcomed progress so far, highlighted the importance of continuing to increase synergies and noted that the three agencies are currently discussing their strategic planning, which offers more possibilities for further collaboration. RBA COVID-19 response The Director-General noted that the COVID-19 global pandemic was a \"turning point\" for the transformation of agri-food systems. He emphasized that FAO had developed a comprehensive Response and Recovery Programme with a strong focus on investment, innovation and data sharing to scale up action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). FAO Deputy Director-General, Beth Bechdol, presented the Joint Response of the RBAs to address the challenges posed by COVID-19 on food security and nutrition, which cuts across four main areas: Country Programming and Planning; Policy and Analytical Support; Advocacy and Information Sharing; and Business Continuity. Bechdol said joint research was being conducted on the impact of COVID-19 in 30 high-priority countries. Individual assessments in the area of policy and support were conducted in a number of countries including Fiji, Haiti and Tunisia, she noted. UN Food Systems Summit 2021 In a video address, the UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, who is also Chairperson of the Advisory Committee of the 2021 Food Systems Summit, informed the meeting that the Summit will take place in September 2021 during the UN General Assembly, while a Pre-Summit will be organized a few months earlier in Rome to prepare for the main event in September. She described it as \"a people's Summit, inclusive and focused on solutions and action.\" The UN Special Envoy for the 2021 Food Systems Summit, Agnes Kalibata, referred to the Summit as an opportunity to redefine food systems, stressing it was important to engage with communities and countries at a local level. The RBAs provided an update on contributions to the Summit as Kalibata urged greater dialogue around the summit's five action tracks: (1) ensuring access to safe and nutritious food for all, (2) shifting to sustainable consumption patterns, (3) boosting nature-positive production at scale, (4) advancing equitable livelihoods and (5) building resilience to vulnerabilities, shocks and stresses.\n\n"},

The FAO Cereal Price Index rose 5.1 percent from August and is now 13.6 percent higher than a year ago. Higher wheat price quotations led the increase, spurred by brisk trade activity amid concerns over production prospects in the southern hemisphere as well as dry conditions affecting winter wheat sowings around Europe. Maize prices also rose, responding to lower production prospects in the European Union and a downward revision of carryover supplies in the United States of America. International sorghum and barley prices rose as well, while those of rice subsided. The FAO Food Price Index, released monthly, tracks the international prices of the most commonly-traded food commodities. The FAO Vegetable Oil Price Index rose 6.0 percent in September, hitting an eight-month high as quotations for palm, sunflower seed and soy oils all rose in step with firm global demand. The FAO Meat Price Index declined 0.9 percent from August, partly influenced by China's decision to ban imports of pig meat from Germany after African swine fever (ASF) was detected among wild boars. The FAO Dairy Price Index was almost unchanged during the month, as moderate increases in the prices of butter, cheese and skim milk power were offset by a fall in whole milk powder quotations.The FAO Sugar Price Index declined 2.6 percent, mainly in reaction to expectations of a global sugar production surplus in the coming season, driven by a significant production recovery in India and strong output anticipated in Brazil. Cereal markets remain well suppliedFAO also released today new forecasts for world cereal production, slightly trimmed from last month's projections, and now pegged at 2 762 million tonnes for 2020, still an all-time high and some 2.1 percent higher than the previous year's output.The new assessment, outlined in FAO's Cereal Supply and Demand Brief, highlights expectations for global coarse grains output of 1 488 million tonnes, marked down by 0.5 percent from the previous report due to weather impacts on maize crops in several large producing countries and buoyed by improving prospects for barley. Global wheat production for 2020 is now seen at 765 million tonnes, a record high, marked up by conducive weather in Australia. World rice production is expected at 509.1 million tonnes, also a record level and unchanged from last month's projections. World cereal utilization in 2020/21 is forecast at 2 744 million tonnes, 2.0 percent higher than the previous year. More than half entails coarse grains, now forecast at 1 477 million tonnes, while wheat utilization is pegged at 757 million tonnes, rising with increased consumption in China and India. World rice utilization is expected to hit a new record of 510.5 million tonnes. World cereal stocks are now forecast at 890 million tonnes at the close of seasons in 2021, a record high buoyed by growing wheat inventories in China. If the new projections are confirmed, the world cereal stocks-to-use ratio in 2020/21 will be 31.6 percent, only slightly down from the 2019/20 ratio but still relatively high from a historical perspective. Global trade in cereals is also expected to reach an all-time high of 448 million tonnes in 2020/21, up 2.4 percent from the previous year and higher than FAO's earlier forecast in September.

The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty, while the number of undernourished people, currently estimated at nearly 690 million, could increase by up to 132 million by the end of the year. Millions of enterprises face an existential threat. Nearly half of the world's 3.3 billion global workforce are at risk of losing their livelihoods. Informal economy workers are particularly vulnerable because the majority lack social protection and access to quality health care and have lost access to productive assets. Without the means to earn an income during lockdowns, many are unable to feed themselves and their families. For most, no income means no food, or, at best, less food and less nutritious food.   The pandemic has been affecting the entire food system and has laid bare its fragility. Border closures, trade restrictions and confinement measures have been preventing farmers from accessing markets, including for buying inputs and selling their produce, and agricultural workers from harvesting crops, thus disrupting domestic and international food supply chains and reducing access to healthy, safe and diverse diets. The pandemic has decimated jobs and placed millions of livelihoods at risk. As breadwinners lose jobs, fall ill and die, the food security and nutrition of millions of women and men are under threat, with those in low-income countries, particularly the most marginalized populations, which include small-scale farmers and indigenous peoples, being hardest hit. Millions of agricultural workers - waged and self-employed - while feeding the world, regularly face high levels of working poverty, malnutrition and poor health, and suffer from a lack of safety and labour protection as well as other types of abuse. With low and irregular incomes and a lack of social support, many of them are spurred to continue working, often in unsafe conditions, thus exposing themselves and their families to additional risks. Further, when experiencing income losses, they may resort to negative coping strategies, such as distress sale of assets, predatory loans or child labour. Migrant agricultural workers are particularly vulnerable, because they face risks in their transport, working and living conditions and struggle to access support measures put in place by governments. Guaranteeing the safety and health of all agri-food workers - from primary producers to those involved in food processing, transport and retail, including street food vendors - as well as better incomes and protection, will be critical to saving lives and protecting public health, people's livelihoods and food security.  In the COVID-19 crisis food security, public health, and employment and labour issues, in particular workers' health and safety, converge. Adhering to workplace safety and health practices and ensuring access to decent work and the protection of labour rights in all industries will be crucial in addressing the human dimension of the crisis. Immediate and purposeful action to save lives and livelihoods should include extending social protection towards universal health coverage and income support for those most affected. These include workers in the informal economy and in poorly protected and low-paid jobs, including youth, older workers, and migrants. Particular attention must be paid to the situation of women, who are over-represented in low-paid jobs and care roles. Different forms of support are key, including cash transfers, child allowances and healthy school meals, shelter and food relief initiatives, support for employment retention and recovery, and financial relief for businesses, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. In designing and implementing such measures it is essential that governments work closely with employers and workers. Countries dealing with existing humanitarian crises or emergencies are particularly exposed to the effects of COVID-19. Responding swiftly to the pandemic, while ensuring that humanitarian and recovery assistance reaches those most in need, is critical. Now is the time for global solidarity and support, especially with the most vulnerable in our societies, particularly in the emerging and developing world. Only together can we overcome the intertwined health and social and economic impacts of the pandemic and prevent its escalation into a protracted humanitarian and food security catastrophe, with the potential loss of already achieved development gains.  We must recognize this opportunity to build back better, as noted in the Policy Brief issued by the United Nations Secretary-General. We are committed to pooling our expertise and experience to support countries in their crisis response measures and efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. We need to develop long-term sustainable strategies to address the challenges facing the health and agri-food sectors. Priority should be given to addressing underlying food security and malnutrition challenges, tackling rural poverty, in particular through more and better jobs in the rural economy, extending social protection to all, facilitating safe migration pathways and promoting the formalization of the informal economy.  We must rethink the future of our environment and tackle climate change and environmental degradation with ambition and urgency. Only then can we protect the health, livelihoods, food security and nutrition of all people, and ensure that our ‘new normal' is a better one.\n\n"},

The heads of the Rome-based UN Agencies (RBAs) reflected on how to improve food security and nutrition and their collaborative commitment to CFS. In his opening remarks, FAO Director-General QU Dongyu encouraged the Committee to use comprehensive and inclusive approaches in its work, with a wider perspective in mind, pointing to promoting innovation and addressing food loss and waste as areas of great importance.\"I strongly believe in the power of innovation and digital technologies as a central tool to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG2 (hunger) and SDG1 (poverty),\" he said.Qu noted that FAO has taken big steps to support its Members to boost innovation, highlighting that a new Office of Innovation was created, major initiatives on big data have been introduced and the first Chief Scientist in FAO's history has been selected.The Director-General encouraged the CFS to put strong emphasis on innovation at large, being a central element in the efforts of all members in transforming agri-food systems.Referring to food waste as \"a matter of instilling a sense of responsibility into the whole society\", the Director-General also called on CFS to bring all its members on board for this important issue with the aim of raising awareness and creating a public momentum towards eliminating food waste.In relation to food loss, he stated that its reduction requires improvements along the value chain as well as the introduction of varieties with a better shelve life, underscoring the need for investments in post-harvest treatment and agricultural infrastructure, from roads, to cold-storage houses and facilities. The FAO Director-General concluded by stressing the need for more \"synergy and complementary activities between CFS and FAO\" and pledging the UN Agency's continued support to CFS in turning its policies and products into concrete action at country level.For his part, the CFS Chairperson said that \"we are at a critical turning point for humanity\", with COVID-19 and conflicts putting additional pressure on our food systems, and stressed the need for a radical transformation of our diets and food systems, if the international community wants to achieve truly sustainable development and the goals of the 2030 Agenda.The President of the IFAD reminded the audience on how much the world relies on small-scale farmers who produce half of all our food calories and underscored the need for strong political will and increased investment to transform rural areas and restructure our food systems. We need food systems that are sustainable, climate adapted, provide nutritious food, inclusive, resilient and above all do not underestimate the small-scale producers, he added.Referring to conflicts, climate extremes and now the COVID-19 pandemic as primary drivers of food insecurity, the Executive Director of the WFP stressed the need to address the hunger pandemic together with the health pandemic, otherwise we risk seeing the number of people dying from an economic deterioration and food supply chains disruption by times higher than what we have seen in a hunger death rate so far.About CFS high-level special eventThe three-day virtual event brings together ministers and other high-level government officials, United Nations agencies, civil society and non-governmental organizations, the private sector, philanthropic foundations, international research centres for food security, and international and regional financial institutions.The CFS High-Level Special event seeks to keep food security and nutrition front and center on the global sustainable development agenda. Three plenary sessions will take place one per day to:• take stock of the global food security situation guided by the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) 2020 report and the CFS High-Level Panel of Experts (HLPE) report on Building a Global Narrative towards 2030;• reflect on the impacts of COVID-19 on global food security and nutrition and efforts needed to \"build back better\" using the HLPE issues paper on Impacts of COVID-19 on Food Security and Nutrition: Developing Effective Policy Responses to Address the Hunger and Malnutrition Pandemic; and• discuss the draft CFS Voluntary Guidelines on Food Systems and Nutrition and the draft CFS Policy Recommendations on Agroecological and Other Innovative Approaches, and consider their relevance to the objectives of the UN Food Systems Summit.To complement the plenary discussions and to give partners and stakeholders an opportunity to highlight their work, CFS will provide space for 12 virtual \"Partners Events\" over the three days.The CFS is the leading international platform for policy coherence and convergence on food security and nutrition. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the CFS Bureau decided to reschedule the CFS 47 Plenary session to 8 - 12 February 2021.\n\n"},

The countries' contribution was finalized through the Technical Assistance Fund (TAF) of the NDC Partnership , a global coalition of countries and institutions committed to supporting climate action and sustainable development.     FAO Deputy Director-General, Maria Helena Semedo, thanked Germany and Sweden for their support saying it would help FAO directly support those countries hardest hit by climate change. \"This valuable contribution not only boosts FAO efforts to assist countries as they tackle climate impacts like severe weather events, rising sea levels and soil degradation, but also promotes resilient and sustainable growth,\" said Semedo. Climate change has been recognized by the United Nations as a threat to global food security and to the concerted efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development. The contribution from Germany and Sweden will be shared between 18 countries under the Climate Action Enhancement Package (CAEP) of the NDC Partnership which groups several donors. The resources, provided by the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany (BMZ) and the Government of Sweden, will be used for diverse programmes including efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support for capacity development. FAO further strengthened its collaboration with the NDC Partnership this year with a funding agreement aimed at fast-tracking contributions to agriculture, forestry and other sectors.  Assistance will be enhanced through FAO's Hand-in-Hand Initiative , a country-led and country-owned programme designed to accelerate agricultural transformation and sustainable rural development in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Vulnerable countries, such as landlocked and least developed countries and small island developing states from Africa, Asia-Pacific, the Caribbean, Central Asia, Europe and Latin America will benefit from country contributions.  FAO has been an active member of the NDC partnership since 2016 and supports countries' efforts to achieve their climate commitments under the Paris Agreement with the goal of maintaining the global temperature rise well below 1.5 Celsius. The NDC Partnership has more than 100 members, including developed and developing countries, and is providing technical assistance and capacity building in over 50 countries.\n\n"},

It is a much deserved recognition of the untiring efforts of generations of humanitarian workers worldwide to defeat hunger. It also turns the eyes of the international community towards the millions of people who suffer from or face the threat of food insecurity. This prize is a new engine driving the food security issue to the forefront, underlining the importance of international solidarity and multilateral cooperation.  Let's redouble our efforts working together under the UN flag with WFP, first established in 1961 as FAO's food assistance subsidiary, and with all key players.

This was the key message of a speech delivered today by FAO Director-General QU Dongyu at the 25th session of the Committee on Forestry (COFO). This year's session of COFO is being convened virtually from 5 to 9 October 2020 under the theme \"Forests and the SDG Decade of Action: solutions for climate change, biodiversity and people\". In his opening remarks, the Director-General noted that the pandemic has shown that forests can serve as a safety net for human beings - particularly the poor and vulnerable - in times of crisis, offering a huge potential in \"building back better\". Given that deforestation and forest degradation continue to take place at alarming rates largely due to agricultural expansion, we need to find ways to increase agricultural production and improve food security without reducing forest areas, Qu said calling for a fundamental change of mindset and remodeling our business approaches.   \"Halting deforestation and scaling up reforestation, must be a central building block to the sustainable transformation of food systems\", the FAO chief stressed. In his remarks, Qu urged to scale-up action to unlock the full potential of forests and food diversity and increase investment in sustainable forest sector as these actions are critical to achieving such global goals as eradication of hunger and poverty, climate change adaptation and mitigation as well as biodiversity conservation. He also made the link to the Green Cities Initiative that FAO launched last month, which aims to transform agri-food systems, end hunger and improve nutrition in cities. He noted that cities are very essential in building back better, as \"cities have the capacity, technologies, investment, information and purchasing power\", adding that they can be the \"promoter and engine of transformation\". This year's session of COFO is chaired by Shin Wonsup, Professor from Chungbuk National University, Cheongiu, Republic of Korea, and former Minister of Korea Forest Service. The opening session saw the participation of Inger Andersen, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme, and Virginijus Sinkevičius, EU Commissioner for Environment Oceans and Fisheries, among others. \"COVID-19 has taught us that we need to reinforce for urgent action,\" Inger Andersen said, noting that a green recovery from the pandemic must promote healthy and restored forests following the transitions laid out in the Convention for Biological Diversity with conserving intact ecosystems, restoring ecosystems and reversing degradation being the priorities. \"But to make these transitions happen we need to transform our food systems, which is the largest deforestation cause and which is the largest biodiversity loss cause,\" she added. For his part, the EU Commissioner said: \"Forests and trees contribute to all four pillars of food security: availability, access, utilisation and stability. If we fail to achieve the SDG 15, in particular managing forests sustainably, and halting and reversing biodiversity loss, we will also fail to deliver on achieving a world free from hunger and more generally on the 2030 Agenda\". FAO's work on forestry FAO, together with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), has been supporting over 60 countries in reducing deforestation and forest degradation, through the UN-REDD programme. The Organization's work on forest law enforcement, governance and trade help countries combat illegal logging and promote trade in timber, which is sustainably produced by small-scale enterprises. FAO's Sustainable Wildlife Management Programme is spearheading efforts to ensure optimal health for people, animals and the environment as part of a One Health approach, while strengthening wildlife management and enhancing food security of local communities. Improving forest-based livelihoods, prosperity and human well-being is the aim of the Forest and Farm Facility. More than 25 million people in 30 countries have directly or indirectly benefitted from this initiative, including during the current COVID-19 pandemic. FAO has also helped to restore the productivity of degraded lands and the livelihoods of local communities in the Sahel. Its support to the Great Green Wall Initiative has resulted in some 50 000 hectares of land being restored. Together with UNEP and the Secretariat of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, FAO has prepared an ambitious action plan to jointly restore 100 million hectares of degraded lands, sequester 250 million tons of CO2 and create 10 million green jobs. About COFO 25 The Committee on Forestry (COFO) is the highest FAO Forestry statutory body. The biennial sessions of COFO bring together heads of forest services and other senior government officials to identify emerging policy and technical issues, to seek solutions and to advise FAO and others on appropriate action. The 25th session of COFO and the 7th World Forest Week (2-12 October) will explore the contributions that the forest sector can make to the SDG Decade of Action as well as to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, including on solutions for climate change, biodiversity and people.In particular, the Committee will examine a range of key global issues, including the impacts of COVID-19 on the forest sector and ways to respond; the role of forests in transforming food systems and mitigating impacts of climate change; contributions of the forest sector to the UN Decades on Family Farming and Ecosystem Restoration; among other topics.  The delegates will also discuss the outcomes of the two previously published flagship reports on forestry: The State of the World's Forests 2020 and the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020. A new publication \"Moving Forward\", which showcases the achievements of the FAO Forestry Programme in 2018-2019, will be launched during COFO.\n\n"},

Donors must spend an additional US$14 billion on average each year between now and 2030, roughly double what they currently spend on aid for food security and nutrition, according to new research from the Center for Development Research (ZEF), Cornell University, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD).Maximo Torero, Chief Economist at FAO, said: \"The world produces enough food to feed everyone. So it's unacceptable that 690 million people are undernourished, 2 billion don't have regular access to sufficient amounts of safe, nutritious food, and 3 billion people cannot afford healthy diets. If rich countries double their aid commitments and help poor countries to prioritize, properly target and scale up cost effective interventions on agricultural R&D, technology, innovation, education, social protection and on trade facilitation, we can end hunger by 2030.\" The call-to-action represents a coming together of two projects - Ceres2030: Sustainable Solutions to End Hunger, led by Cornell, IFPRI and IISD, and joint research from FAO and ZEF. Both sets of findings will be presented at an event on 13 October hosted by the German government, where donors are expected to pledge money to the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme (GAFSP).Ceres2030 and FAO-ZEF used different methodologies but arrived at the same conclusion that donors should double their spending. Ceres2030 built a computable general equilibrium economic model to assess the best way to end hunger sustainably, in line with the second UN Sustainable Development Goal.David Laborde, Senior Research Fellow at IFPRI, said: \"We found that if donors double their aid, alongside poorer countries also increasing spending from their own budgets, then by the end of the decade we could end hunger, double the incomes of 545 million small-scale farmers, and limit agricultural emissions in line with the Paris climate agreement.\"Joachim von Braun, Director of ZEF and Chair of the Scientific Group that advises the UN on the upcoming Food Systems Summit, said: \"Our study shows that an additional $39 billion to 50 billion per annum is needed to end hunger by 2030, as envisaged by the second Sustainable Development Goal. To make good on the promise that G-7 countries made in Elmau in 2015 to lift 500 million people out of hunger, requires donors to spend an additional $11 billion to 14 billion per annum, which is about double their current aid spending on food security. This investment must contribute to long-term development and sustainability.\"Ceres2030 also developed a groundbreaking new AI machine-learning tool, described in a paper in Nature Machine Intelligence,which was used by a young, female-led team of over 70 researchers from 23 countries to answer eight research questions covering areas such as water scarcity and employment for the future. The findings were published in a new collection of 8 peer-reviewed journal articles in Nature Research, which show how governments can best target their spending to end hunger, whilst also increasing the incomes of smallholder farmers and reducing the impact of agriculture on the environment.Jaron Porciello, Associate Director at Cornell University, said: \"We used our new Artificial Intelligence tool to analyse half a million articles from the last 20 years. The tool helped us identify the 10,000 most relevant articles, from which we could then draw valuable conclusions about what works to end hunger. This approach could be replicated to build a scientific evidence base for many of the world's most complex policy problems. We urge governments to use our findings to ensure their aid spending is as effective as possible.\"The Ceres2030 and FAO-ZEF studies both recommend that donors make interventions that are evidence-based and designed to support each other, including investing in agricultural R&D, supporting social protection programs that provide food or cash to those in aid, and driving inclusion, such as through improving female literacy and providing training for rural youth. Spending should focus on where the need is greatest - primarily sub-Saharan Africa, and also south Asia.Carin Smaller, Director of Agriculture, Trade and Investment at IISD, said: \"This is a call to action. If rich countries double their aid commitments on food security and nutrition, the end of hunger will be within reach. With just 10 years to go to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals, we need a concerted, coordinated effort - led by evidence and fuelled by adequate funding. Our five organisations have provided donors with the evidence they need to end hunger sustainably, now it's time to act.\"UN Special Envoy Dr Agnes Kalibata and German Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development Dr Gerd Müller wrote in a foreword to Ceres2030's findings summary paper: \"The study comes at a critical time. The dramatic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis are exacerbating the suffering of the most vulnerable, especially in the poorest regions of the world. For them, the COVID-19 pandemic is also a hunger pandemic. With this in mind, next year the UN Food Systems Summit will launch bold new actions, solutions and strategies to deliver progress on all 17 Sustainable Development Goals, each of which relies on healthier, more sustainable and more equitable food systems.\" \n\n"},

The Director-General of FAO, QU Dongyu, today participated in the launch of the 2020 State of Climate Services Report at a virtual high-level event hosted by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which produced the report with inputs from FAO and 15 other international agencies and financial institutions through the Global Framework for Climate Services. The report was released on the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction. \"Pre-emptive action underpinned by effective weather data, early warning systems and disaster risk assessments can save millions of livelihoods in times of conflict and natural disaster,\" Qu said. The Director-General stressed that many countries lack early warning systems and capacities. He also noted the COVID-19 pandemic had increased the vulnerabilities of the most-at-risk communities - such as farmers, pastoralists, fishers and foresters - to climate shocks and natural hazards.  \"Early warning, Early action is therefore a key guiding principle for my administration in FAO to deal with potential risks for the global agri-food system, even before the latest outbreak of locust and the COVID-19 Pandemic,\" said Qu, who alluded to his experience as former Vice Governor and leading coordinator responsible for agricultural, meteorological and disaster-prevention affairs in Ningxia Province of China. \"I fully understand the importance of early warning systems to the agricultural sector and rural livelihoods,\" he added.  FAO in action The Director-General explained how early warning systems, big data and digital technology have been driving FAO's work and commitment to get ahead of disasters and build better lives and livelihoods, emphasizing that the UN agency was looking forward to scale up its anticipatory action in the future. The Hand-in-Hand Initiative already employs sector specific climate indicators like water productivity, precipitation anomalies, agriculture stress and advanced crop calendars, many of them developed jointly by FAO, WMO and global experts. It also incorporates, through the Geospatial Platform, over 1 million geospatial layers, thousands of statistics series with 4,000 metadata records at the global and regional level covering (amongst many others) climate, soil, land and water information. The FAO Digital Services Portfolio informs Crop Calendars for more than 130 crops located in 283 agro-ecological zones in 44 countries; and the FAO Data Lab has been providing recommendations on planting and harvesting during the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, FAO's Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS), established after the food crises of the early 1970s, continuously monitors food supply and demand and other key indicators for assessing the overall food security situation in all countries of the world. It issues regular analytical and objective reports on prevailing conditions and provides early warnings of impending food crises at country or regional level. During the meeting, Qu cited the example of Bangladesh to show how joint efforts can anticipate the impact of floods. In July this year, the fastest allocation in history by the UN Central Emergency Response Fund significantly mitigated the damage. The Director-General also highlighted the results achieved by FAO's Desert Locust Information Service which has provided early warning against the ongoing locust outbreak in East Africa. FAO's research, which provides one of 16 case studies in the 2020 report, triggered control and surveillance operations that spared 350,000 pastoral households from livelihood loss and distress, he said. Main findings of the Report The 2020 State of Climate Services Report, presented by WMO Secretary-General, Petteri Taalas, found that climate change is having a devastating impact on the world's most vulnerable people. In the past 50 years, it said more than 11,000 disasters have been attributed to weather, climate and water-related hazards, resulting in 2 million deaths and $3.6 trillion in economic losses. In 2018 around 108 million people required help from the international humanitarian system as a result of storms, floods, droughts and wildfires, the report noted. By 2030, it is estimated that this number could increase by almost 50 per cent at a cost of around $20 billion a year The situation is particularly acute in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Since 1970, SIDS have lost $153 billion due to weather, climate and water related hazards - a significant amount given that the average GDP for SIDS is $13.7 billion.  Meanwhile, 1.4 million people (70 percent of the total deaths) in LDCs lost their lives due to weather, climate and water related hazards in that time period. Mami Mizutori, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction described the report as a \"timely and important contribution\" to risk reduction.  While she noted that 93 UN Member States have early warning strategies in place, there needed to be more cohesion and funding for nationally resourced meteorological services.Representatives from the Adaptation Fund, Agence Francaise de Developpement, the Climate Policy Initiative, the Green Climate Fund, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies also participated in the high-level event.\n\n"}
