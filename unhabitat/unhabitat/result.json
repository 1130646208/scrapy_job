Today about 80 per cent of the population already lives in cities,\" said the Minister of Public Works, Services and Housing, Iván Arias.\nThis urban policy was developed through a broad and plural participatory process that involved nearly 250 sessions and workshops throughout the country, including two National Urban Forums,  in which more than 7,000 representatives of institutions and organizations participated.\n“For us, it has been very gratifying to be able to support this process for more than two years, supporting Sustainable Development Goal 11 to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. The Cities Policy is also in full alignment with the New Urban Agenda, which was issued in Habitat III and assumed by the Bolivian government,” said the Executive Director of UN-Habitat, Maimunah Mohd Sharif in a video.\nDuring the event, the Vice Minister of Housing and Urban Planning, Vladimir Ameller, symbolically delivered the document of the Cities Policy to the President of the Association of Municipalities of Bolivia (AMB), Rocío Molina, as the municipal governments of the urban centres will lead and implement this initiative.\n“This proposal is a first impulse, a dynamo that will be transferred to the real protagonists, the cities. (The City Policy) is a proposal that respects and deepens the autonomous regime; it is and should be concluded in its implementation stage with, for and from the cities, which are ultimately its reason for being,” the Vice Minister specified.\nRepresentatives of international cooperation, groups and urban entities, as well as departmental and municipal authorities from different cities in Bolivia took part in the event.\nThe Cities Policy is the strategic instrument to guide urban development, which identifies and proposes public policies to address challenges and take advantage of the opportunities posed by the urbanization process to contribute to the diversification of the economy, reduce inequalities and ensure sustainability.\nThe policy is being deployed on three levels: intra-urban, urban-territorial and urban-national. Its objectives are to achieve inclusive, healthy cities with a good quality of life and productive, orderly, sustainable and resilient cities, in addition to the governance of the city.\nThe policy has a timeframe of around 15 years, or three legislative periods, coinciding with the rounds of the Comprehensive Planning System of the State, as well as with the two major milestones in international agendas: the Sustainable Development Agenda of 2030 and the IV Conference of the United Nations on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development of 2036.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/bolivia-presents-its-new-cities-policy-for-urban-development", "abstract": "La Paz, Bolivia, October 7, 2020. – To mark World Habitat Day, Bolivia’s Ministry of Public Works, S..."},

More than 50 participants attended the workshop, including national and local government officials, NGO and private sector representatives, youth representatives, academics and researchers from Niger State of Nigeria and Zanzibar.\nThis virtual workshop is a continuation of the implementation of the UN Development Account funded project “Leaving No Place Behind- Strengthening Urban-Rural Linkages in Africa”. The four-hour workshop shared the outcomes of previous workshops, presented and discussed the impacts of COVID-19 in each country and proposed way forward for the project aiming to address issues arising from the pandemic by strengthening urban-rural linkages.\nMr. Barr Mukhtar Nasale, the Commissioner of the Ministry of Land and Housing of Niger State, delivered welcome remarks and expressed the State’s commitment to the implementation of the project. Mr. Mohammad Habib, Director of Department of Urban and Rural Planning Commission for Lands, Zanzibar and Mr. Makame A. Muhajir, Urban Policy consultant from Zanzibar showed their appreciation for UN-Habitat’s continuous support for the promotion of Urban-Rural Linkages in Zanzibar.\nThe outcomes of a previous workshop that took place in Zanzibar in 2019 were presented, including the relevant Urban-Rural Linkages Guiding Principles identified in each country and the challenges hindering the connectivity and flow of resources and services between urban and rural areas. Recommendations to overcome the identified challenges were as well identified by participants.\nThe teams from both the Niger State  and  Zanzibar  also presented the challenges they’ve faced during the pandemic across the urban-rural continuum. Niger State has suffered from a drastic decline in rural investment and the disruption of food supply chains due to restrictions on mobility.  Dr. Abdul Husaini further introduced the inadequate access to medical facilities and limited humanitarian access in rural areas. In Zanzibar, the pandemic has exposed the issue of lack of ICT facilities in rural areas, affecting governmental services, and impacting education services.  As a country whose economy heavily depends on its tourism industry, the drastic decline of tourists has taken a toll on the income of many. It was also signaled that the pandemic reduced rural to urban migration, slowing down the urbanization process in Zanzibar.\nAfter the presentations, both teams were given the time to discuss possible activities to accommodate COVID-19 crisis and revised action plan, as well as to identify pilot projects. Zanzibar identified improving rural infrastructure, produce storage and transportation and ICT facilities as their priorities. Niger State proposed possible pilot projects in sustaining the supply chain of agricultural produce and strengthening rural healthcare system. The importance of engaging rural communities in the planning process was also highlighted. As a conclusion, participants asserted the importance of multi-stakeholder, multi-sector, multi-level interventions and engagement for strengthened urban-rural linkages so no one and no place will be left behind.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/virtual-regional-workshop-on-implementing-urban-rural-linkages-during-covid-19-pandemic", "abstract": "Nairobi, 15 October 2020 - UN-Habitat successfully held the virtual workshop “Implementing the UNDA ..."},

Attendees included members of Garissa County Assembly Lands Committee, Dadaab and Fafi Sub-Counties, UNHCR and UN-Habitat.\nAs the first phase of developing the Advisory Strategy for the Regeneration of Ifo 2 and Kambioos, a project funded by the European Union Trust Fund, UN-Habitat has been carrying out a comprehensive spatial assessment of the two camps within the sub-county, county and national contexts. The assessment is helping to inform a profile of the area which both describes and analyses the camps through an urban planning lens with the aim of establishing an evidence base that will be used to develop future interventions and guide future investment.\nThe purpose of the workshop was to present the findings of the spatial assessment that UN-Habitat has developed so far and receive feedback from the stakeholders. Additionally, a preliminary planning session was carried out to consider the opportunities and challenges that the decommissioned sites present which stimulated lively discussion and constructive action points for further exploration as the planning process gathers momentum. Garissa County Executive Member for Trade, Tourism and Enterprise Development Mr. Adow Kalil Jubat called on participants to contribute tangible ideas in order to create a sustainable development plan that will benefit local communities.\nThe morning session of the workshop comprised presentations by UN-Habitat on the key messages taken from the spatial assessments, followed by feedback and discussion. In the afternoon session, participants broke off into groups to prepare SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analyses of Ifo 2 and Kambioos camps.\nWhile various threats and weaknesses were identified for both camps, there was great emphasis on the opportunities the camps presented. These opportunities spanned a wide range of themes including the agricultural potential of existing green belts and orchards, the educational potential of Ifo 2’s underutilized school facilities, the climatic opportunities of harvesting rainwater and solar energy and the economic opportunities of encouraging new small businesses and industries such as bee-keeping in Ifo 2  and bottling of borehole water in Kambioos.\nThe workshop concluded with discussion of the take-aways and next steps of the project, with emphasis on additional stakeholder engagement which will be undertaken with the support of Garissa County and UNHCR.\nThe stakeholder workshop was an especially vital component of the project, particularly as COVID-19 has placed limitations upon-the-ground data gathering and fieldwork that was initially planned for this project. In response to travel limitations, UN-Habitat has been remotely developing and digitizing new spatial data which, in addition to contributing to the Ifo 2 and Kambioos spatial profile development, will have the added benefit of providing Garissa County and development agencies with a more extensive database of spatial information in the future. This is due to be developed and validated as part of the field survey due to kick off imminently.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-and-garissa-county-hold-stakeholder-workshop-on-decommissioned-refugee-settlements", "abstract": "Garissa Town, Kenya 8 October 2020 - UN-Habitat, in collaboration with the County Government of Gari..."},

Globally, more than 60 percent of refugees and 80 percent of internally displaced people reside in urban areas, even though numbers in the East African region vary, due to a lesser level of urbanization in the region in general.\nThe session started with an introduction by the co-host, UNHCR’s Senior Livelihoods and Economic Inclusion Officer in the Regional Bureau for East, the Horn and the Great Lakes, Ms Anna Gaunt, presenting the official numbers of refugees and asylum seekers in urban areas in the region. Stephanie Loose from UN-Habitat then highlighted UN-Habitat’s mandate and general approaches for supporting people in vulnerable situations in urban areas UN-Habitat’s mandate and general approaches for supporting people in vulnerable situations in urban areas. Being the UN agency aiming to advance sustainable urbanization as a driver of development and peace to improve living conditions for all, UN-Habitat underlined its area-based, multi-stakeholder and multi-level governance approaches, and highlighted inclusive participatory processes as one means for enabling the social and economic inclusion of refugees into urban societies and its aim to improve urban systems, that benefit both host and refugee/displaced communities. \nThose approaches have been applied in different urban contexts in the East African region, and UN-Habitat’s Somalia team, represented by Mr Matthew Flynn, then presented how they are translated in urban displacement contexts, starting with a multi-sectoral, spatial data analysis of the urban areas (“urban profiling”) to inclusion of local actors, including government authorities, civil society and private sectors and beneficiaries in participatory planning processes for agreeing on priorities for actions. Spatial planning led to better access to basic and urban services and helped to improve urban environments.\nLack of adequate housing was identified which then led to the development of large housing project, which, due to its rental schemes, will also lead to increased, long-term increase in local revenue which can be used for further investments in the areas.\nMr Flynn also shortly introduced the recently launched “Settlement profiling tool[1]”, a joint tool developed by UN-Habitat and UNHCR, which will be presented in the Regional Economic Inclusion group in December.\n“Reducing vulnerabilities of migrants, displaced and refugees residing in urban areas needs cross-sectoral coordination. Specifically in urban contexts, there needs to be an urban-system and integrated approach, to make sure that interventions benefit people in vulnerable situations communities from both host and refugee communities”, he said.\nThe second part of the session started with a presentation by AGORA, an initiative that promotes efficient, inclusive and integrated local planning, aid response and service delivery in areas affected by crisis. Ms Louise Thaller from AGORA introduced an urban assessment of Kampala, Uganda. AGORA advocates for multi-sector recovery needs and localizes response planning and aid delivery beyond sector specific approaches and stands up for technical support for local actors that lead to tangible results and foster collaboration between exogenous aid actors, local stakeholders and public authorities. The Kampala Urban Assessment (2018) showcased the relationships between needs, area of residence and displacement status – highlighting the interdependence of those factors and underlining that in many cases, not the legal status, but gender had more impact on vulnerability.\nThe session was concluded by a presentation on UNHCR’s initiatives for fostering market access for products produced by refugees, MADE51 and Bawa Hope. MADE51 is an innovative, market-based model that promotes economic inclusion of refugees in global value chains. In the MADE51 model, UNHCR identifies refugees with artisanal skills, helps refugees create strong artisan groups and connects these groups to experienced local social enterprise partners.  MADE51 is also a tangible way to demonstrate solidarity with refugees while helping refugees earn valuable income while Bawa Hope is a Fair-Trade company which works with marginalized handicraft artisans in Kenya\nThe session brought together different approaches for fostering economic inclusion of migrants, refugees and displaced persons in urban areas, and highlighting that urban displacement needs tailored, multi-sectoral approaches that include local actors and respond to specific local contexts as well as creating enabling environments for refugees and displaced to become self-reliant and live dignified lives.\n \n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/unhcr-and-un-habitat-co-moderate-%E2%80%9Crefugees-and-asylum-seekers-in-urban-areas%E2%80%9D-session", "abstract": "Nairobi 7 October 2020--Within the framework of UNHCR and NRC's’ monthly East and Horn of African Re..."},

Abdihakim Osman, the UN-Habitat JPLG Project Officer said that this model was adopted as it is an effective and sustainable way of ensuring that public institutions are empowered to respond to the emerging needs of their fellow citizens. “It is our hope that the councillors, being at the local level will be keen to apply the knowledge and experience gained from this training in order to advance the development of their communities.” he said.\nJPLG recognizes the importance of capacity building to equip local councillors with the tools to play a positive and decisive role in dispensing their duties in the council and ensure a sustainable future for all in Somalia within the country’s rapidly urbanizing environment.\nThe training covered the 12 globally endorsed roles of councillors dubbed “councillor’s hats”. The ‘power broker’ role which prescribes that institutional power should be used for public interest was what Qamar Dhiblawe, one of the women in Warsheikh council noted as needful towards improving their council.  The training also offered the councillors an opportunity to investigate their weakness and brainstorm on best ways of enhancing service delivery in their respective councils while learning from their best practices.\nThis was the first training of its kind delivered to local leaders in Hirshabelle State selected into office by the community. Speaking at the launch of the training, Hirshabelle state president Mohamed Abdi Waare said, “It is my hope that Warsheikh being the first district in Hirshabelle to select the representatives of their choice will be a model council for our local governance system.” He commended UN-Habitat and the donors for empowering the local council.\nGlobal goals recognize cities as the primary drivers of economic development due to their ability to facilitate agglomeration economies that induce sustained growth.

The event, jointly organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) and UN-Habitat marked another milestone of the collaboration between the two agencies on the topic.\nThe event brought together high-level technical experts to discuss the renewed urgency of addressing homelessness within the context of a COVID-19 new normal.\nDuring the event, Mr. Robert Lewis-Lettington, Chief of UN-Habitat’s Land, Housing and Shelter section, highlight the fact that “as the United Nations we must respect, protect and fulfil the rights of the most vulnerable. People experiencing homelessness are amongst them. If we want to make our cities sustainable and inclusive, we must address homelessness”.\nAt the end of his remarks, he launched the new UN-Habitat Proceedings Report of the 2019 Expert Group Meeting on “Affordable housing and social protection systems for all to address homelessness” that took place in Nairobi 22 - 24 May 2019. The report collects and analyses the contribution of the experts who participated in the EGM and aims to broaden the understanding of the complex causes of homelessness.\nMs. Daniela Bas, Director of the Division for Inclusive Social Development of UN DESA, further stressed during the meeting the complex and global nature of homelessness and how, she says, “it affects people from different ages, geographical areas and backgrounds and this has become increasingly visible today with the COVID19 pandemic”. According to Daniela Bas, “we must build on the strong political will and the actions that have been taken to address homelessness during the pandemic to recover from the COVID19 crisis and build back better”.\nOther leading voices in the field of homelessness prevention discussed strategies to better map and tackle the root-causes of homelessness and to support government in their effort to end homelessness forever.\nMs. Dame Louise Casey, Chair of the Advisory Committee of Institute of Global Homelessness (IGH), pointed out that “a lot of funds have been spent on developing strategies to solve ‘symptoms’ of homelessness without addressing the root causes of the disease. To address homelessness, we must prevent the recurrence of its driving factors”. She also stressed the importance of data for devising evidence-based and effective policies. On this point, she said “if we do not count homelessness, we do not see homelessness and IGH is committed to partner with any willing stakeholder to conduct a global homelessness survey”.\nMs. Christina Behrendt, Head of ILO’s Social Policy Unit, Social Protection Department, discussed the need to strengthen social protection systems and the delivery of affordable housing to address homelessness, building on the positive initiatives taken by governments globally during the COVID-19 emergency phase. According to Christina Behrendt, during the pandemic “208 countries have improved in different ways their social protection systems, with 131 housing or basic services related measures in 86 different countries”.\nMr. Freek Spinnewijn, Director, European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless (FEANTSA), addressed the issue of harmonizing the definition of homelessness and presented the European Typology of Homelessness and housing exclusion (ETHOS). He said: “the ETHOS definition tries to capture homelessness as a process and its features across different scenarios. ETHOS does not promote hierarchy in gravity within categories of homelessness. It features collateral and indirectly related issues such as asylum and gender-based violence as well as long term solutions”.\nThe webinar also served as a platform for amplifying the voices of those who experienced homelessness. Ms. Liz Madden and Ms. Iris Bailey shared their experiences on what it means to be homelessness and how they overcame this experience. Ms. Madden pointed out that “being given a home was just the first step toward ending her homelessness situation. For many people homelessness is a state of mind that is hard to escape without experts’ support”. Ms. Bailey shared the real-life stories of friends and relatives who were left behind, suffered homelessness and lacked support to change the situation.\nParticipants agreed that homelessness is the result of a structural failure to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. As Ms. Bailey said at the end of the event, “everyone should have the right to say ‘this is my mail and address’, ‘my home’, ‘I am going home’ and ‘I live here’ ”.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/world-homelessness-day-2020-housing-and-social-protection-at-the-core-of-homelessness-prevention", "abstract": "Nairobi, 12 October 2020 – On the occasion of World Homelessness Day, UN-Habitat hosted a webinar on..."},

She highlighted how COVID-19 has been the biggest advertisement for adequate housing, and for collaborative action towards housing for all. \n“At a time when universal access to adequate housing is a frontline defence against the coronavirus, nearly 1.8 billion people live in overcrowded or inadequate housing, slums and slum-like conditions, or in a state of homeless­ness, with acute risks of exposure. The pandemic has shown how deeply housing relates to people and communities’ health, dignity, wellbeing, inclusion and safety,” she said.\nAfter sharing challenges and opportunities emerging from the COVID-19 crisis, participants agreed on a set of key recommendations for the promotion and protection of the right to adequate housing in the COVID-19 recovery and post-recovery phase. Participants generally recommended that housing be clearly acknowledged as a fundamental human right and called for governments to prioritize the social function of housing and land by, among other actions, preventing over-speculation on housing assets. This could be done by strengthening regulation on real estate markets and via tax laws that prevent speculation on land and housing.\nParticipants also called for the rental social housing sectors to be strengthened and further developed with an increased public investment in social housing, specifically low-income housing. They also said there was a need to coordinate, cooperate and collaborate among all global housing stakeholder to find innovative and out of the box solutions to housing challenges and maximise efforts.\nPreventing forced evictions and mitigating the social and economic drawback of evictions were other key recommendations. Participants said it was essential to ensure the security of tenure for all especially in informal settlements, including by providing incremental in-situ upgrading and finally they said that self-construction methodologies should be developed to reduce costs and environmental footprint using simple, culturally adequate and standardised structural housing elements.\nClosing the meeting, Shipra Narang Suri of UN-Habitat committed the agency to drawing from the insights shared during the meeting to propose a renewed framework for cooperation, coordination and collaboration among all housing stakeholders to maximize efforts and fully realize the right to adequate housing for everyone and leave no one behind.\nParticipants in the roundtable included Martha Delgado, Undersecretary for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights, Government of Mexico; Yves-Laurent Sapoval, Senior Advisor for the Directorate for Housing, Urban Development and Landscapes, Government of France; Anacláudia Marinheiro Centeno Rossbach, Regional Manager for Latin America and Caribbean, Cities Alliance;  Grzegorz Gajda, Senior Housing Specialist, European Investment Bank; Marissa Plouin, Specialist of the OECD Directorate for Employment, Labour and Social Affairs; Danielle Grossenbacher.

We have seen hospitals overflowing, jobs disappearing, schools closed and movement restricted. But we can, and we will recover, and use our experiences to build back better and greener.\nSome of the key opportunities are highlighted in World Habitat Day’s theme this year - Housing for All: A Better Urban Future.\nHousing is now widely recognised as a frontline defence against COVID-19, with residents across the world being told to stay at home and wash their hands. But these simple measures are impossible for the 1.8 billion people living in inadequate housing conditions, informal settlements, overcrowded homes, homelessness, and unstable housing conditions.\nCities and towns have moved quickly to provide emergency housing solutions and shelter for the homeless, quarantine spaces, to postpone evictions and truck in water. We must not allow these achievements to be reversed once the pandemic is over. These temporary measures need to lead to long term policy changes.\nOtherwise, poverty and inequalities will be further exacerbated, and millions of people are at risk of losing their homes, once temporary bans on evictions are lifted, or when the lack of the stable income results in missed rent or mortgage payments.\nAt the same time, we must recognise that providing adequate housing is a shared responsibility, which depends on national and local governments, civil society, businesses, and local communities working together.\nUN-Habitat is launching a five weeks long campaign on ‘Housing for All’, to spread the message that housing is more than just a roof. Adequate housing is central to providing shelter against safety and health risks. It is an essential condition of living in dignity, and the basis for belonging and wellbeing, and a key for access to public spaces, job opportunities, hospitals, schools, and food.\nInclusive, affordable, and adequate housing is the central to transforming our cities and communities and making them resilient, and to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 11 and all the SDGs.\nOn World Habitat Day, we need to join forces to respond to the current crisis, share solutions and create cities of the future for everyone.

The central message of the Campaign is that housing is not just a roof. It is a human right and contributes to health, dignity, safety, inclusion and well-being.\nDuring the five weeks, acclaimed Danish film director Boris B. Bertram will share his documentary The Human Shelter‘ for the first time with a global audience in order to reflect on the fundamental role of housing for people and communities. The Human Shelter is available with subtitles in all UN languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Russian. To access the subtitles click 'settings' and then 'subtitles' for language options.\nDuring the launch of the Housing for All Campaign at the Global Observance of World Habitat Day on 5 October, UN-Habitat Executive Director, Maimunah Mohd Sharif, will introduce a short clip of extracts from the film.\n \n‘The Human Shelter’ is an inspirational exploration filmed on four continents, taking the public to extreme social, economic and environmental conditions worldwide and presenting a series of  testimonies that look at  various dimensions of human living. Boris Bertram’s film investigates the question of ‘what makes a home?’ and explores different people’s ways of creating their homes around the globe. In a refugee camp outside Mosul, in a shanty town on the lagoon in Lagos, or in six square metres in the megacity of Tokyo. The Director also visits the Sami reindeer herders in the Arctic Circle, and NASA’s futuristic Mars habitat in Hawaii, USA.\n“Each location and scene in the film is intended to surprise the audience eye. In the making of the film, I have met human beings living on next to nothing, but insisting on living poetically in a world which is constantly changing. That is inspiring!” explained the Film Director.\nFunded by IKEA, the documentary is a result of a two-year worldwide cinematographic expedition that allowed a deep exploration and generates provoking questions on the essence of housing around the world.\nThe Film will be made available to the public online from 5 October to 6 November 2020 for free on UN-Habitat’s Youtube channel.\nBoris Benjamin Bertram is a filmmaker, producer and partner in the Copenhagen-based Good Company Pictures. Educated at the National Film School of Denmark as a documentary director in 2005, he also holds a graduate degree in social psychology and communication.

This year’s observance highlights the centrality of housing as a driver for sustainable urban development.\nCurrently, 1 billion people live in overcrowded settlements with inadequate housing. By 2030, that number will rise to 1.6 billion. Action is needed now to provide low-income families and vulnerable populations with affordable housing with security of tenure and easy access to water, sanitation, transport and other basic services. To meet global demand, more than 96,000 housing units will need to be completed every day – and they must be part of the green transition.\n \nThe urgency of improving living conditions has been brought to the fore by COVID-19, which has devastated the lives of millions in cities. Access to clean water and sanitation, along with social distancing, are key responses to the pandemic. Yet in slums it has proved difficult to implement these measures. This means an increased risk of infection, not only within slums, but in whole cities, many of which are largely serviced by low-income informal sector workers living in informal settlements.\n\nOn World Habitat Day, in this crucial Decade of Action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, I call for heightened efforts to promote the partnerships, pro-poor policies, and regulations needed to improve housing in cities. As we strive to overcome the pandemic, address the fragilities and inequalities it has exposed, and combat climate change, now is the time to harness the transformative potential of urbanization for the benefit of people and planet.\nThe Secretary-General Video Message on World Habitat Day 5 October 2020:\nArabic | Chinese | French | English | Russian | Spanish (PDF)\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/the-secretary-general-video-message-on-world-habitat-day-5-october-2020", "abstract": "Each year World Habitat Day focuses attention on the state of the world’s towns and cities.

The pandemic is having a huge impact on all areas of life in metropolitan areas but also provides an opportunity to rethink the role of metropolitan governance in crises. World Metropolitan Day, which marks the anniversary of the Montréal Declaration on Metropolitan Areas (2015), provides an opportunity not only to focus on the importance of metropolitan governance to create more sustainable, liveable and healthy cities; but also the challenges and opportunities created by the pandemic.\nDuring the ongoing World Metropolitan Day 2020 campaign, metropolitan governments and a wide range of institutions worldwide (private companies, academic institutions, civil society organizations, multilateral entities, city networks and urban influencers) have been sharing initiatives aimed at accelerating a positive transformation in cities as a response to COVID-19 and at achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe pandemic requires coordination across all the administrations at different levels and the urban-rural continuum, and rethinking the current metropolitan governance systems.\nWhile being recognized as engines of economic growth, metropolitan areas are also the source of major inequalities and environmental challenges. The measures brought in to control COVID-19 have probably exacerbated this phenomenon. Moving forward metropolitan governance must prioritize the issue considering that around a third of the population, nearly 2.6 billion people currently live in metropolitan areas.\nThe event will bring together various local governments representing Buenos Aires, Barcelona Metropolitan Area, Barcelona City, Municipality of Cordoba, Madrid City, Mexico City and Montreal along with the Asian Mayors Forum, UCLG Africa, and the Marmara Municipalities Union, among others entities.\nThis event will take place in the framework of the Urban October, a month of celebrations that begins with World Habitat Day on 5 October focusing on Housing for All:A Better Urban Future and ends with World Cities Day on 31 October under the theme Valuing our communities and cities.\nFor more information on the World Metropolitan Day campaign and registration for the event, please visit: https://www.metropolis.org/campaigns/world-metropolitan-day   \n \nAbout Metropolis\nThe World Association of the Major Metropolises (Metropolis) is the global network of major cities and metropolitan areas.\nMetropolis brings together the governments of 141 urban agglomerations worldwide.

Through the project, additional 104 houses were reconstructed; and 98 houses were repaired.\nOne beneficiary, Duth Chhundy said: “When we are in solidarity with others in the community, we can gain a lot of benefits.

The purpose of the workshop was to receive feedback and facilitate discussions with Turkana County officials on the potential land-use proposals based on the existing situational analysis as well as proposals provided by the community, private sector, National and County Government Ministries and agencies from previous multi-level and multi-sector meetings. This plan would also support the County Government in having the plans needed for the conferment of the proposed Kakuma-Kalobeyei Municipality.\nDay one of the workshop began with an overview of urban development in Turkana County followed by UN-Habitat’s presentation of the Spatial Profiling of Kakuma and  Kalobeyei. The Spatial Profile is a multi-sectoral assessment of Kakuma and Kalobeyei, collating and creating spatial data to help inform decision making, specifically regarding the location of the Kakuma-Kalobeyei Municipality. Discussions of the Spatial Profiling was guided by a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis of Kakuma and Kalobeyei, with the aim of clarifying, verifying and identifying gaps in the research that has been conducted so far. This analysis was able to confirm some of the major findings of the profile while also adding new perspectives to topics such as the tourism potential of Kakuma-Kalobeyei, changing political dynamics, the green energy potential of Turkana County and environmental conservation.\nDay two of the workshop was focused around presentations of the Socio-economic Survey, the Business, Local Economic Development Survey and the Kalobeyei Corridor Development Plan by UN-Habitat. Each presentation was followed by a question and answer session to understand the perspectives of the local authorities. Topics that arose from these discussions included the institutional arrangements to support the local economy, environmental management of the invasive species Prosopis juliflora, value chains such as retail and commercial charcoal and timber production and climate change. It also included proposals for potential industrial investments like the meat production and processing plants as well as logistics and transport planning which is key in stimulating local businesses and promoting flow of goods, services, capital and people in north-western Kenya part of the LAPSSET corridor.\nDuring the workshop Chief Officer of Turkana County Government Ministry of Lands, Housing, Energy and Urban Areas Management, Joshua Lemuya,  highlighted that “the planning of the Kalobeyei Infrastructure corridor and the spatial profiling work will significantly contribute to the process of attaining the proposed municipality status for Kakuma and Kalobeyei”. \nThe Director in charge of Physical Planning from Turkana County Government Ministry of Lands, Housing, Energy and Urban Areas Management, Davies Munialo, added that “the next phase of the planning process of the Kalobeyei corridor plan will focus on completing the development of the final land use proposals and probably have the plan submitted to the County Government before the end of the year 2020”.\nThe workshop concluded with discussions of ways forward, including the arranging of follow-up bilaterals with Turkana County Departments for further detailing of data and agreement for another multi-sectoral workshop to be organised soon. Semi-virtual and multi-sectoral workshops such as these have become essential due to restrictions of personnel movement that are expected to continue for the foreseeable future.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-and-turkana-county-government-meeting-moots-development-in-kenya%E2%80%99s-turkana-county", "abstract": "Kakuma, Kenya 7 October 2020 - UN-Habitat has been collaborating with Turkana County Government in v..."},

Having cities like Barcelona to lead urban innovation and support others is living proof that the change is possible.”\nThe deputy mayor for the 2030 Agenda, Digital Transition, Sports and Territorial and Metropolitan Coordination of Barcelona City Council, Laia Bonet stated: “the pandemic has been a stress test that has shown us that we must build more resilient cities at a social, ecological, urban and digital level. This means responding to the social emergency; addressing the digital divide through digital inclusion policies, and accelerating the ecological transition to a healthier and more democratic urban model.”​\nThis new agreement provides an opportunity to revisit goals and to focus on current realities: providing high quality technical expertise and provision of innovative solutions in areas related to urban resilience; and facilitating access to field experiences, tools, knowledge, and current capacity development and training methodologies, with a special focus on COVID-19 response and recovery.\nAs a follow up of to this agreement, during Urban October, Barcelona City, UN-Habitat and local partners SUEZ and Cetaqua, are organizing the Urban Resilience in a context of Climate Change (URCC) conference on October 20 and 21. This online meeting is open to all and will bring together participants from academia, administrations, companies and local communities to exchange knowledge and share challenges and solutions in cities, with a special focus on European urban areas.\nBarcelona City is recognized as a centre for promoting research in urban sustainable planning, urban governance and risk management, as a leader in urban innovation and digital transformation and a reference for other municipalities. It supports cities in developing countries (city-to-city cooperation), such as Maputo (Mozambique) and Dakar (Senegal) in expanding their capacity to implement actions for resilience.

UN-Habitat China together with its partners in Wuhan and with collaborating national agencies, published four detailed papers on the emerging experiences on responding to COVID-19 in Chinese cities and towns.\nCOVID-19 broke out at an epidemic scale in Wuhan, in January 2020 with initial lessons on responding being learned in this metropolitan city of 10 million people but also in the secondary and county towns of Hubei Province. A wide range of measures were implemented to roll back the epidemic and restart the social-economic recovery. When municipal departments re-opened, UN-Habitat reached out in order to learn about and share the know-how around the response.\nUN-Habitat has been closely working with Wuhan and  with the municipal planning institute, the Wuhan Land Use and Spatial Planning Center (WLSP) since 1916 developing a programme to promote and develop improved public spaces in Wuhan. An international Placemaking Week was organized in late 2018 and thematic explorations on child-friendly city strategies and healthy cities began in 2019.\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, UN-Habitat set up a local partnership with WLSP and Wuhan University and invited the national agencies, CITIC General Institute of Architectural Design and Research, the Institute of Public and Environment Affairs and the China Women’s Development Foundation to be part of the initiative to develop the COVID-19 Wuhan Guidance Papers.\nThe first two Papers deal with Community Management Approaches and with the provision of non-hospital spaces for care and isolation. The capacity to support communities by organizing them in a citywide grid, with clear protocols on controls and quarantine was already established in Wuhan in February 2020. Existing smartphone platforms were adapted to the lockdown needs. Meanwhile, the health response was quickly complemented with new and converted quarantine centres. The Papers are complemented by three case studies, including one on sewage treatment challenges to which the private sector responded.\nTwo more Papers are about smart technologies. A first one shed light on the quick introduction of QR Apps and Big Data for Tracking and Mapping of people, indicating whether they were cleared to move around or requiring self-isolation. The final paper shows how tracking and mapping were used to steer the Resumption of the Economy and Community Life. More case studies show how mobile phones became essential, both in the response but also for the recovery, for instance as a tool to distribute consumption coupons.\nIn the e-launch of today, Mr. Yan Chung, the Deputy Director General of the Wuhan Natural Resources and Planning Bureau, expressed his gratitude for the global collaboration with China and Wuhan in fighting against COVID-19 and appreciated the sharing of experience amongst the collaborating institutions. Senior staff from the involved agencies and institutes presented the Papers. Panel discussions were moderated by Ms. Milena Ivkovich of ISOCARP and Mr. Wang Yu of NTNU (Norway).\nIn one of the panel discussions, Professor Serge Salat of Paris Special School of Architecture observed that the Wuhan papers highlight the big data and deep learning potential when engaging planners and public health professionals, to build together a spatial epidemiology science as the study of spatial and temporal variation in disease risk or incidence in urban environments. He added that “this approach has proven being very efficient in China in terms of timely information release, real-time risk monitoring, online communication and collaboration, trend analysis and judgment, and remote medical assistance. It has saved thousands of lives while ensuring a quick recovery of economic functions.”\nIn her closing remarks, Ms. Christine Knudsen, UN-Habitat’s Director of Emergencies, noted that COVID-19 is still a global scourge causing ill health, death, crisises and poverty, especially for the most vulnerable communities. She appealed to partners in Wuhan and China to increase their collaboration with UN-Habitat and cities in need to develop data-driven solutions in support of green and inclusive recovery and resilience plans.\nThe COVID-19 Wuhan Guidance Papers are available online in English and Chinese. In 2020 and 2021, UN-Habitat and WLSP will continue their collaboration, with a strong emphasis on urban health.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-china-and-partners-in-wuhan-share-covid-19-response-experiences", "abstract": "Wuhan, China, 2 September 2020 - The COVID-19 Wuhan Guidance Papers were released globally today in ..."},

The webinar introduced the recently launched sourcebook, “Integrating Health in Urban and Territorial Planning” developed jointly by UN-Habitat and WHO.\nOver 100 participants attended the webinar from all over India. The participants included Municipal Commissioners, CEOs, Managing Directors of Smart Cities, State Pollution Control Board Officials, State and District Health officials, Data / Technology Officers, Project Management Consultants (Team leaders and ICT experts), Master System Integrators, researchers, data enthusiasts and officials from city and state urban departments.\n“What is a smart city if it does not address health, if you are not healthy, why are you making smart cities?” questioned Kunal Kumar, Joint Secretary and Mission Director, Smart Cities, MoHUA in his opening remarks.\nDr. Marcus Grant, lead author of the sourcebook underscored the need to improve health equity at the community level while recommending the contextualization of an asset-based and people-centric approach to this integrated form of planning.\nDr. Nathalie Roebbel, Coordinator, Air Pollution and Urban Health, WHO Geneva, explained that the sourcebook is a starting point towards the larger vision of implementing the New Urban Agenda. She shared an example of how the WHO had applied this concept to develop housing and health guidelines, taking into consideration the policies and standards that needed to be put in place to make the housing stock equitable and healthier to live in.\nHerman Pienaar, lead of the Urban Lab, Planning, Finance and Economy Section at UN-Habitat said COVID-19 had been a massive stress test on the urban environment and a strong reminder of the gaps in the functioning of existing urban systems. He stated that for better success in blending health in urban planning, investments needed to be prioritized towards areas such as public open spaces that are currently labeled as ‘soft issues’, but in reality, contribute positively to the cumulative physical and mental wellbeing of citizens, and in long term, resilience and equitability in cities.\nD. Thara, Joint Secretary of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), MoHUA, highlighted that apart from a few selected cities like Chandigarh and Gandhinagar,  growth patterns of cities in India have primarily been organic, where the population settles first and then is provided with the basic facilities by governing institutions in a ‘fire-fighting’ manner, catering to the areas which are in the most dire need of an intervention.\nShe added that MoHUA is taking steps to implement GIS-based master planning in 500 Indian cities. From these, the 90 cities that have already completed the process represent 60-70% of the total urbanized areas in India.\nJyoti Rawat, Joint Commissioner, National Urban Health Mission shared the actions taken by the Government of India to reduce the infection of COVID-19 in urban areas and increase the health services delivery to the people during the lockdown.\nA pre-webinar survey found that  70 per cent of the participants thought that health professionals can efficiently contribute to urban and territorial planning by providing data and technical assistance on health statistics and demographics. In addition 55 per cent of the participants  mentioned that the biggest challenges to integrating health in urban and territorial planning are a lack of institutional capacity to foster intersectoral collaboration and the absence of an ­­enabling policy environment to integrate public health targets in the planning sector.\nLearn more about integrating health in urban and territorial planning.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/india-hosts-webinar-on-integrating-health-in-urban-planning", "abstract": "New Delhi, 10 September 2020 - UN-Habitat and partners recently held a webinar to address how the pl..."},

It also aims to encourage innovations for achieving the urban and safety dimensions of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. \nThe 40 Days Safer Cities Challenge is a direct follow-up to the adoption by Member States of the UN systemwide Guidelines on Safer Cities and Human Settlements at the first UN-Habitat Assembly in May 2019. The Safer Cities Challenge coincides with Urban October, a month to raise awareness on issues and opportunities of urbanization. During these 40 days, UN-Habitat and the partners of GNSC will mobilise individuals and organizations around the world to showcase innovative solutions to address the challenges of urban crime and violence in communities. This year the challenge will focus on the increasing inequalities and social challenges which have been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. It will include a milestone event on the World Mental Health Day on 10 October with the cast of the film, Suicide Saint, made by independent filmmaker Hezues R, founder of Guns for Camera charity (USA) and a partner of the Global Network on Safer Cities (GNSC), promoting the use of film and arts to address mental health and wellness, a key indicator for safer cities.\nThe celebrations of the International Day of Peace include the ‘Peace One Day’ event in New York, in support of the SDG16+ Peace in Our Cities Campaign activities.  UN-Habitat Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif will address the panel of city game changers, comprising inspiring individuals who have championed city grown solutions to tackling urban violence.\nWhile urban crime and violence vary across the world in types and intensity, cities see safety as a key prerequisite for sustainable development.

Following the Port of Beirut explosions on 4 August  this year World Cleanup Day has a different meaning in Lebanon. While UN-Habitat, together with the rest of the humanitarian community works on preparing the reform, recovery and reconstruction framework in response to the blast (3RF), the agency is also addressing the rubble and debris management issue.\nFollowing the blast, more than 20 UN-Habitat team members took part in the #UN4Beirut initiative on 8 August, to clean up glass, debris and rubble from the  streets of Beirut and help vulnerable residents clear their damaged houses.\nTogether with partners, UN-Habitat co-launched a “Rubble to Mountains” initiative, to prevent an  environmental waste crisis. This initiative aims at sorting the quantities of rubble, concrete, iron, plastic, glass, and nylon and and turning them into material for landfill in mountains severely eroded by quarrying.  The initiative will include  producing  benches, bus stops, recycling bins and other essential items.\nCurrently UN-Habitat, along with the Environment Sector under the Reform, Recovery and Reconstruction Framework (3RF), the framework which will guide the country in recovering from the blast in the months to come, are putting in place a sustainable framework and action plan for dealing with construction and demolition waste through mainstreaming reforms of solid waste management in this area, and ensuring a proper recovery and reconstruction processes.\n“The management of disaster debris is critical to protect human health, prevent environmental impacts, reduce injuries and conserve disposal capacity. Debris management is one of many competing priorities that must be managed in the aftermath of a disaster, it involves planning and coordination among several entities at different levels, engagement with the private sector and innovative thinking. UN-Habitat is proud to be part of the “Rubble to Mountains” Consortia,”” said Taina Christiansen, Head of the UN-Habitat Country Programme in Lebanon.\nMessage for the Executive Director of UN-Habitat Maimunah Mohd Sharif on World Cleanup Day\n“ Waste Management is an increasing problem that cities of the world face. The current COVID-19 crisis has only added to the problem by exposing people who handle waste to  an increased risk of contracting the disease. On this World Cleanup day, I urge everyone to reduce their waste generation and cities to support the  efforts of citizens to reduce waste and dispose of all waste in a safe and environmentally sound manner. UN-Habitat’s “Waste Wise Cities” now has a membership of 165 cities. I urge other cities to join this initiative and share their experiences and good practices in waste management with other cities “.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/this-year-world-cleanup-day-has-a-different-meaning-in-lebanon", "abstract": "Beirut, 19 September 2020.

The United Nations has made significant progress over the decades in improving peace and security, poverty reduction, clean water and improved sanitation, gender equality, and other critical areas of development.\nIn 2000, the world was introduced to the ground-breaking concept of the Millennium Development Goals. Fifteen years later, we adopted the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with clear targets to be achieved by 2030. The New Urban Agenda helps nations harness urbanization as a catalytic force to deliver the SDGs.\nIn the past 75 years, the world has come a long way in our commitment to ensure adequate shelter for all. The built environment and the rapid rate of urbanization are now changing the very nature of the planet. By 2050, 70 per cent of humanity will live in urban areas and this year 95 per cent of all COVID-19 cases have been found in our towns and cities. Our fate is inextricably bound up with the places we call home - be it an informal settlement, a village or a city.\nNo journey is smooth. At this point in our history, the achievement of the SDGs may seem far away. Yet, I believe we can reach these Goals by empowering individuals, communities, neighbourhoods and cities to take small steps together.\nWe need to be inspired by past generations, we need to harness the drive of our youth, capture the wisdom of our elders, and encourage innovation and creativity at all levels.\nIf humankind is to survive, we need a global revolution of empathy. The next 75 years will be crucial as future generations will depend on us to make the right decisions today.\nAbove all, we need action on the ground, advocacy in the virtual world and commitment to do whatever it takes to leave future generations a better world, where no one and no place is left behind.\nDownload the statement here.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/statement-by-the-executive-director-of-un-habitat-maimunah-mohd-sharif-on-the-75th-anniversary-of", "abstract": "On this occasion of the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, we must not forget the good work of ..."},

The initiative, set to kick off in September 2020, will finance 25 Water Operators’ Partnerships (WOPs) over four years with the goal of advancing the operational, financial, social and environmental performance of beneficiary utilities, and improving the lives of the communities they serve.\n\nThe newly-approved EU WOP Programme will be implemented by the Global Water Operators’ Partnerships Alliance (GWOPA), an extensive UN-Habitat-led network with more than ten years’ expertise in promoting, facilitating and tracking WOPs. Commenting on the signing of the agreement, the Executive Director of UN-Habitat, Maimunah Mohd Sharif, highlighted that, “the EU-WOP Programme comes at a critical time as the world is once again reminded of the importance of water and sanitation utilities, and the enormous potential for them to learn from one another.”\n\nUnder-performance in a water utility often means unsafe water, frequent cuts, and limited coverage for communities, with women, the poor and other vulnerable groups disproportionately impacted. While the current COVID pandemic has highlighted the extent to which extent resilient water and sanitation utilities can ensure the wellbeing of communitie even during a crisis, many utilities are facing mounting challenges. Among the different approaches adopted to support them, WOPs stand out because of their emphasis on strengthening local capacity through peer mentoring. By building the local capacity of utilities, WOPs favour more sustainable, affordable and higher quality services over the long-term, and support local achievement of global targets such as SDG6 and the universal human rights to water and sanitation.\n\nJointly designed by the EU and UN-Habitat, the EU WOP Programme will begin with the launch of an international call for proposals for North-South and South-South partnerships between utilities. An independent selection committee will evaluate the proposals and select those that best meet programme criteria. Successful utilities will then be funded to implement their WOP over a three-year period with ongoing guidance and support from GWOPA.\nFurther details on selection criteria, overall timeframe, and eligibility will be available shortly on www.unhabitat.org\n\nFor media enquiries, please contact:\nCraig Laird, Partnerships and Outreach Expert, UN-Habitat GWOPA\nE-mail: craig.laird@un.org\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/european-union-boosts-progress-towards-sdg6-through-a-9-million-euro-wop-programme-with-un-habitat", "abstract": "The EU Water Operators’ Partnerships Programme, funded by the EU and implemented by UN-Habitat GWOPA..."},

Organized by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)  and the University of South Pacific, the two-day event focused on pacific youth engagement for global action during COVID-19.\nSome 30 youth from over 10 Pacific countries participated in discussions centered around socio- economic impacts of COVID-19 in the Pacific, with a special focus on human rights, food security and climate change. The participants exchanged experiences and ideas on how the youth can participate during panel discussions, group work, thematic presentations by OHCHR, FAO, UNDP, UNFPA, and many others, as well as interactive artwork sessions.\n‘Informal settlements are disproportionately affected by the pandemic, and climate change brings out and exacerbates existing vulnerabilities’ said Kamsin Raju, one of four FRIS Resilience officers based within an FRIS target municipality. ‘But there is also a lot of potential. For example, youth groups are organizing support for older community members, or there are tutor programmes by older students to help younger children with homework.’\nLed by UN-Habitat, the participants joined hands in painting a mural to express how they experience the pandemic: on one side it tells a story of pain and suffering (the hands symbolize cries for help due to unemployment, rising crime and violence, and food insecurity).

The lectures feature renowned experts discussing cutting-edge research and practical recommendations on advancing urban sustainability and the Sustainable Development Goals in cities. Season 6 consists of 10 lectures.\n \nIn this lecture, Jaideep Gupte from IDS, the Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex, presents cutting edge evidence on the importance of data for inclusive urban governance in the Global South. The lecture shows how data and policy innovations can further security provision for all.\n \nDownload audio\n \nSYNOPSIS\nIssues which the lecture addresses\nViolence in cities significantly compromises development and can have detrimental consequences for peace-building and political settlements in both conflict and non-conflict settings. The majority of the world’s most fragile and conflict-affected countries are rapidly urbanising, while much of the global burden of violent crime can be directly or indirectly linked to cities. But cities also abound with social, cultural and technological innovation and can bring 'smart' solutions to complex problems. Efforts to provide security, build political settlements and create safe cities for all need to go beyond reviewing simple statistics of death, destruction and violent crime. They need to engage 'the city' as a complex system.\n \nShort analysis of the above issues \nUrban violence is shaped by and shapes the physical and social landscapes of urban communities. For example, fear of violence prompts the physical separation of high-violence neighbourhoods from surrounding areas, and can force women, men and children to adapt their daily life to avoid areas prone to violence on their way to work, around their homes, or when they play. Beyond the psychological impacts of such circumstances, adapting one’s way of living in this manner usually also has a direct financial cost resulting out of the need to build barriers, take longer routes to work, or forego livelihood opportunities due to safety concerns. Implementing effective violence mitigation strategies therefore requires stakeholders to acknowledge varying types of urban violence, understand how these interact with the mechanics of security provision, and thereby bring a data-driven, spatially relevant, and city-specific thinking to how security is provided, and for whom it is provided. \n \nPropositions for addressing the issue\nJaideep Gupte begins by presenting the nature and extent of urban violence, and summarises cutting edge evidence on data driven approaches to urban security provision in the global south. Approaches that seek to securitise the city are juxtaposed with inclusive visions of the city where no one is left behind.\nThree main conclusions are arrived at: (1) To see urban institutions and process as central to security provision. Useful starting points in this regard are to focus on the ‘grid’ or the spatial design, layout and planning of the city to determine the institutions that exclude and include people, with a particular focus on the gendered dimensions that shape everyday realities of those living with violence or in conflict settings. (2) To set clear guidelines for policy responses and policing intervention to recognise different types of violence, particularly in the face of the varied nature of the experiences of violence and ‘everyday insecurity’ for city dwellers. (3) Consider identifying urban futures that are possible, probable, and preferable. Future scenario-planning approaches are useful in helping to assess the nature of future challenges, the types of policy response these might necessitate, and the potential long-term impacts of these interventions. Integrating urban futures within the frameworks of peace-building and political settlements in a rigorous and systematic way is essential as the world continues to urbanise, particularly in the most fragile and conflict-affected contexts.\n \nBIOGRAPHY\nDr Jaideep Gupte is a Research Fellow at the Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex, where he co-leads the Cities Cluster at the Institute of Development studies, and co-convenes the MA in Poverty and Development.

Then, over a period of two weeks in July and August, the settlements were each supplied with 500,000 litres was supplied by water tankers.\nThe activity was part of a European Union funded COVID-19 mitigation intervention under the Hargeisa Urban Water Supply Upgrading Project (HUWSUP) and implemented jointly with Hargeisa Water Agency.\n“We are happy to partner with UN-Habitat in the provision of water to these vulnerable communities, which will ensure improved hygienic measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Somaliland, raise awareness about the pandemic among the urban poor, as well as ensure that they have water for their domestic use,” said Mohamed Daarod, Director of the Hargeisa Water Agency.\nUN-Habitat also provided stocks of soap and water to the existing hand washing stations, set up in different strategic locations within the settlements. Asha Ahmed, UN-Habitat National Project Officer and Head of the Hargeisa Office, encouraged the community to use the water to promote their overall hygiene and frequently use the hand washing stations to minimize the risk of contracting COVID-19.\nSpeaking on behalf of the beneficiary communities, the chairpersons of the settlements, Mr. Omar Adan Araale and Mr. Yusuf Ibrahim Qaalib said the community was grateful for the continued interventions by UN-Habitat. “Provision of water was such a fundamental intervention in the face of a pandemic. We are also happy that the supply of water was timely and aligned with the Eid-al-Adha celebrations at the end of July,” said Mr. Qaalib.\nIn May, UN-Habitat and its partners completed work on the 23-kilometre-long main pipeline between the Ged Deeble wellfield and the Hargeisa water reservoir to Hargeisa City under HUWSUP. The next and final phase of the project will increase the amount of water available for Hargeisa from nine to 14.5 million litres per day, with the potential capacity to expand production to 24 million litres per day.\nJimcaale is a resettlement scheme with permanent housing, built in 2015 for 145 IDP families who previously lived in an informal settlement around the main Hargeisa Reservoir site.

The company is the biggest investor in the island, with a focus on responsible tourism. As part of their investment to transform Roça Sundy into a hotel and a resort, HBD –for which many community members work for– agreed with the community to improve their housing conditions but since this was a big intervention in the island, the Regional Government contacted UN-Habitat to provide technical assistance for this endeavor.\nUN-Habitat’s Sustainable Resettlement Project in Roça Sundy directly benefits some 511 inhabitants (6% of the total population) through a Public-Private-People’s Partnership. The project implementation started in 2016 with the objective “to implement the voluntary and sustainable resettlement of the community of Roça Sundy, for improving their living conditions with full respect for human rights and through a participatory approach”.\nIn Terra Prometida, the new settlement for Roça Sundy community with 133 houses, including infrastructure and basic social facilities, the construction site had mobilized around 150 workers among them contractors, subcontractors, suppliers and sources of labor before the pandemic.\nThis was the biggest construction site in the recent history of the Island and unconfirmed reports of imported cases in the Island obliged UN-Habitat to plan with the local team for its potential evacuation, since the local health system is extremely weak and all complex health issues are dealt in São Tomé or even abroad.\nOn the other hand, evacuation also posed the danger of damaging the agency’s reputation with the local government and local community, since testing was lacking and no claimed imported cases were symptomatic, making the locals to believe that the virus never arrived in the Island. Based on these challenges, UN-Habitat together with the local team decided to anticipate and plan for different scenarios. The project immediately downgraded the number of workers in the construction site, also because the logistics to the Island was affected by the lockdown, compromising the delivery of key materials.\nUN-Habitat’s core team based in Principe developed an evacuation plan in case of any staff getting infected. Additionally, the government considered the project as an essential service, since the project became one of the most important economic activities in the island after the lockdown affected its most important economic sector: tourism.\nMany COVID-19-related safety measures took place for the continuation of the project. Personal protective equipment (PPE) was provided to staff to minimize risks for local spreading. Besides that, division of workstations, creation of work shifts, limitation of number of people in the project transport, compulsory use of masks in the project site, the banning of lunch in the construction site, creation of a handwashing station and the establishment of a sanitation team responsible to promote the adequate hygiene in the construction site were other measures adopted by the project.\nThese were complemented with awareness raising in the workplace focusing on workers to keep the measures in place. The project is currently in the end tage and even though the construction schedule is delayed especially due to constraints in logistics and lack of availability of some materials, thanks to our local team and the commitment of the workers and community members, the project became an important example of safe workplace in the Island that promotes the health of its worker while minimizes the potential socioeconomic impact of the pandemic in Principe.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-executes-a-model-safe-project-in-sao-tome-in-the-middle-of-the-covid-19-pandemic", "abstract": "Roça Sundy, Sao Tome and Principe 18 August 2020—UN-Habitat’s technical knowhow recently came in ha..."},

Local governments need to be innovative and pioneering to generate revenues, streamline expenditures and maintain provision of basic urban services,” said Mohamed Ali, the Director of Regions and Districts Administration at the Ministry of Interior in Somaliland.\n“With the world rapidly embracing digital technologies, JPLG sought to introduce and establish a system that would ensure a digitalized and efficient tax administration system, which will in turn influence improved and decentralized service delivery, as Garowe keeps up with digital trends,”   said Abdirazik Mahmoud Ali, Municipal Finance Office with JPLG.\nAccording to the World Bank, over 72 per cent of the Somali population have access to mobile phones. Since the launch of the pilot tests in April this year, there has been a significant difference in revenue collections.  A comparison between the revenue collected in the first quarter of 2019 and 2020 show a steady increase in revenue and similar trends are anticipated in other revenue streams, mainly property tax, which is billed twice a year.\nThe Mayor of Garowe, Ahmed Said Muse, thanked UN-Habitat and JPLG saying that the mobile money payment system was an important factor for maximized revenue in Garowe Municipality.\n“We look forward to doubling our revenue base as we are currently updating the property database,” he said.\nGarowe, Puntland’s capital, introduced a one dollar service tax to its residents which was tied to utilities such as water and electricity. As a result, USD 558,000 has been raised jointly by Garowe local government and city residents and the funds used to reconstruct 1.8 kilometres of the main road serving Garowe town.

We are also grateful to all our donors who support our emergency response around the world\nIn 2020, as needs are outpacing funds and with extremely difficult restrictions in our towns and cities, humanitarians including UN-Habitat have responded to the massive spike in humanitarian needs around the world. UN-Habitat engages national and local authorities to bring together a collective urban response in emegency situations.\nHumanitarian responses need to be targetted effectively to ensure we assist the most vulnerable. UN-Habitat is working with community groups using mobile aps to map the needs and responses in informal settlements. This enables us to make sure the right assistance goes to the right people.\nDespite countless challenges and suffering, refugees, displaced people and local communities in urban areas are often the first responders who save  lives during times of crisis.They represent the best of humanity. They are #RealLifeHeroes.\nAround 90 per cent of people with COVID-19 are in cities and towns which the UN-Secretary General has called the ‘ground zero’ of the pandemic. City authorities are at the forefront of efforts to overcome this pandemic and to build back better. On World Humanitarian Day UN-Habitat recognizes that their leadership has saved countless lives.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic shows the resilience and ingenuity of our urban communities who have found solutions to prevent and contain the spread of the virus. On World Humanitarian Day UN-Habitat highlights the contribution of local action now and to finding durable solutions .\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exposed deep inequalities in the way people live in cities. Nearly a quarter of the world’s urban population are in informal settlements  and the most vulnerable people have been hit the hardest. UN-Habitat supports youth groups in Kenya to halt the spread of  COVID-19 by providing public handwashing facilities, masks and information using murals and kiosks in informal settlements. So far there have been 1.5 million handwashes at these facilities.\nSome 300,000 people were made homeless by the massive explosions in Beirut.

Other measures mentioned include partial or full lockdowns, bans on inter-city movement, night curfews and regular fumigation of public places.\nAlthough regular handwashing is a recognized method of controlling the spread of COVID-19, only 15 per cent of respondents said they always had access to hand washing or sanitization facilities in public spaces; 35 per cent had regular access to the services; 34 per cent had limited access; and 8 per cent of the respondents had no access at all.  The remaining 8 per cent said restrctions on movement meant they could not access public spaces.\nThe most significant challenge for urban households included working from home, reduced incomes due to pay-cuts and job losses and supporting children with their school work. At the neighbourhood and city levels, the most significant impacts include disruption in goods supply chains affecting prices.  According to the survey, three quarters of the respondents had witnessed a change in the price of food and non-food items in their cities. For 83 per cent the price had gone up with only 1 percent noting a decrease in prices.  \nIn terms of urban security and safety, the adopted COVID-19 response measures and their enforcement (such as reduced movements and curfews) led to mixed results with some cities seeing an increase in security with others recording a worsening security and safety situation. Some cities have seen the levels of safety fluctuate over time.\nOver half of respondents  (52 per cent) said there had been a change in public transport in their city or neighbourhood. The changes included a reduction in the number of passengers allowed,  partial or complete shutdown of public transport systems, price fluctuations and mandatory facemask wearing.\n“The data generated from this survey helps us to estimate the extent of COVID-19 spread in cities and urban areas and the impact of the pandemic on urban residents, and complements other information coming from countries and other organizations, which is key to designing urban-specific response strategies,” said Robert Ndugwa, Chief of UN-Habitat’s Data and Analytics Unit.\nThe full survey results can be accessed here.

These new rules are particularly  challenging in the central region, as most of the schools are still recovering from Cyclone Idai, which struck the country in March 2019. UN-Habitat is adapting the implementation of the Basic Emergency School Plan (BESP) to include prevention and preparedness to COVID-19.\nUN-Habitat, in partnership with UNICEF, has been implementing the BESP in schools across the country since 2015 reaching more than 40 schools to date. Thanks to the support of the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations - ECHO and the Education Cannot Wait Fund, capacity trainings and direct implementation of the BESP began on 5 August 2020 in the central region in the Districts of Dondo, Gondola and Chimoio.\nThe BESP’s main objective is to implement a plan that will prepare schools for potential disasters and emergencies. This is particularly essential in Mozambique as it is one of the countries most vulnerable countries to climate change in Africa suffering from increasingly intense climate shocks.\n \n“When Idai came, we didn’t have a tool like the BESP to prepare ourselves. Many of the things I learned today on disaster preparedness I didn’t knew at the time, every school should have access to this tool.” says Sergio Gove, Headmaster of Dondo’s Secondary School.\nThe BESP implementation is an inclusive and participative process and to ensure its sustainability and efficiency, all the school community- headmasters, teachers, parents, community, and students, including the youngest ones- must be involved. All these actors will be part of an Emergency Management Committee and together will define each one’s responsibility to prepare in case of an emergency as cyclone, flood, and now COVID-19.\nOne of the components of the BESP trainings is to ensure access to information to school community members and, with the support of the National Disasters Management Institute (INCG), train them on the different types of emergency alert. “When Cyclone IDAI came, a lot of people didn’t have proper information or didn’t believe that a cyclone of this magnitude was coming. I am sure that now if it happens again everyone, including the school, will properly prepare” says Valnice Antonio, primary school teacher of 5 de Julho School in Dondo. \nAs the virus continues to spread in Mozambique, UN-Habitat’s team has included the participation of a School Health Specialist frm the District Education Departments to integrate preventive and preparedness measures to COVID-19 in the trainings. “Some of the parents are a little scared to send back their kids to school, but I think if we are prepared, we will be able to protect ourselves and go back to study again.” says Isabel, a 16 year-old student from Dondo’s Secondary School and member of the Emergency Management Committee.\nUN-Habitat and UNICEF will continue the capacity trainings and BESP implementations throughout the cyclone affected regions of Sofala, Manica and Cabo Delgado and the entire country, to ensure resilient schools and communities for a safe and uninterrupted access to education.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-includes-covid-19-prevention-as-schools-prepare-to-reopen-in-cyclone-affected-region-of", "abstract": "Beira, Mozambique, 27 August 2020 - UN-Habitat in Mozambique has adapted its activities on disaster ..."},

The resulting Settlement Profiling Tool uses geo-spatial analysis, simple illustration and mapping out of information in government development policies, strategies and other humanitarian and development actor plans to help ensure wider access and understanding.\nThe user-friendly Tool guides local authorities and humanitarian-development professionals such as UN Agencies, donors and NGOs  through an iterative process of investigation with the aim of developing a common baseline of information. The project donor was UNHCR.\nAccording to Yuka Terada who leads the Planning for Humanitarian and Development Practice in UN-Habitat, “this tool can be utilized to enhance the efficiency of humanitarian activities and bridge the gap towards development oriented progress”.\nThe Tool aims to enable stakeholders to prioritize investment opportunities and make informed decisions for refugee and hosts communities and provide entry points for more sustainable development trajectories.\nThe Settlement Profiles produced as a result of this Tool use an urban planning lens to provide a comprehensive overview of the relevant physical, social-economic and policy dynamics affecting a particular settlement, provide a selection of development scenarios and recommendations of potential ways forward.\nThis Tool has been piloted in Nakivale, Uganda and Kebribeyah, Ethiopia. Kebribeyah in particular has hosted refugees for over 28 years, is the oldest refugee settlement in the Somali Regional State and has a history of trade links between the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. It presents unique opportunities to strengthen cohesion between refugees and host community and address ongoing challenges facing the settlement and region which include protracted instability of Somalia, rapid urbanization of the district and the poor living conditions and infrastructure in the refugee settlement.\nThe Mayor of Kebribeyah and his team are using the Settlement Profile to support further planning initiatives in the city, including the potential replanning of the refugee settlement area to allow for improved and more equitable water service provision, road access and housing upgrading.

The report was released in English and Chinese.\nEstablished in 2019, CFCC is chaired by Lu Weiding, the Chairman and CEO of Wanxiang Group in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. Wanxiang Group, established in 1969, has 40,000 employees manufacturing electric mobility solutions and clean energy systems and is developing smart solutions for urban development.\nThe Vice-Chair of CFCC, Pan Shengdong, co-leads the Chengdu based high-tech company Xinchao Media, which introduced smart displays for residential elevators in China which also monitor safety issues such as earthquake events. Other Chinese companies, such as JD Digits, Huawei, AIpark, BOE and KE.com supported the report.\nDuring the online launch, UN-Habitat’s Executive Director, Maimunah Mohd Sharif observed how e-governance is reshaping the relationship between governments, companies and citizens in many ways including the delivery of inclusive public services and with regard to digital rights. Noting that she had launched the CFCC initiative in Beijing in April 2019, the Executive Director welcomed the report and its contribution to the strategic results of UN-Habitat.\nThe launch video was moderated by journalist Zhang Yanfei. Chen Jun, representing Lu Weiding, focused on the importance of scientific and technological innovation in the development and transformation of cities. He explained that given the Wanxiang Group’s footprint in the industrial heartland of the Zhejiang Greater Bay Area, near Shanghai, it was developing comprehensive and integrated smart city technologies in the Innova City development. \nPan Shendong highlighted the speed at which, he said, well-conceived, well-developed e-solutions can be rolled out in China and transform daily living saying his company reaches 100 cities, 600,000 elevators and 200 million residents. When the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, it broadcasted safety messages in its elevators together with UN-Habitat.  \nThe CFCC report reviews China’s emergent smart urbanization policy frameworks as well as the efforts of private sector companies to establish urban service platforms.

IDP camps, being densely occupied increase the risk of transmitting the virus,” said Sophos Sophianos, Midnimo project programme manager.\n He added: “we will apply these guidelines in the IDP camps we work in both in Beledwenye under the Midnimo project and in Mogadishu under the EU-Reinteg Project.”\nUN Habitat, within the framework of Midnimo II project, took lead in drafting the decongestion guidelines which was an initiative of the UN Peace Building Fund. UN-Habitat has been an active member of the Shelter Cluster, actively advocating for decent housing. \nSomalia has 2.6 million IDPs who live in more than 2,000 crowded living sites in urban and semi-urban areas with limited access to quality essential healthcare, water and sanitation services. COVID-19 also poses challenges in terms of access to basic services.\nDecongestion, involves reducing the human density in the IDP settlements in order to maintain social distance which will in turn reduce the likelihood of the virus transmission.\nThis decongestion guidance note explores approaches to decongestion emphasizing on the need to engage the community for a successful decongestion exercise, and highlights the place of camp leaders  and camp governance committees when it comes to infrastructure  mapping and rearrangement needs.\n A standard operating procedures framework was also developed outlining activity steps that partners should adhere to for successful site decongestion exercises.  In the wake of the pandemic, it was noted that the inclusion of Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and protection partners was paramount during site decongestion activities.\nThe Shelter Cluster together with CCCM cluster will update SOPs based on learnings from the field as necessary. \n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/decongestion-of-idp-settlements-as-a-prevention-and-control-measure-for-covid-19-pandemic-in", "abstract": "August 2020- The Shelter Cluster, Camp Management and Camp Coordination Cluster (CCCM) and UN-Habita..."},

The project brings together Planet Smart City and the Participatory Slum Upgrading Programme (PSUP), a partnership initiative of the African Caribbean and Pacific group of States Secretariat, the European Commission and UN-Habitat. Planet Smart City will use its expertise in technology, data analytics and community engagement alongside UN-Habitat´s technical expertise on slum upgrading to deploy digital and on-the ground solutions that empower slum communities to coordinate locally-led initiatives and raise living conditions.\nSince 2008, the PSUP has been working to achieve the Sustainable Development Agenda, in particular Sustainable Development Goal 11.1, which, by 2030, aims to ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services, and upgrade slums. This partnership will use the broad experience of the PSUP in slum upgrading and gather lessons learnt from leveraging private sector engagement for improving the living conditions of the one billion slumdwellers worldwide. \nAt the heart of the initiative is Planet’s proprietary Planet App, a mobile platform that will act as a digital hub for community engagement. Through the app, slum residents will be able to access news and services, including materials for the prevention of diseases, as well as book medical point services and borrow shared tools and equipment. Moreover, the app will serve as a platform for local coordination, allowing residents to organise community initiatives, participate in savings groups and view a calendar of activities and educational courses.\nCore to the long-term goal of realising financial independence for slum community members, the Planet App will also be deployed to support local entrepreneurship, giving a platform for residents to coordinate and promote their services both within their communities and to the wider area around the slum. It can also be used to link slum community members to employment and training opportunities in Nairobi.\nThrough this partnership, Planet will also support communities to develop a community hub where events and activities can take place. Planet and UN-Habitat will work in collaboration with local partners, community champions and NGOs such as Shining Hope for Communities and Slum Dwellers International (SHOFCO), to collect and analyse data on the needs of local residents. This will allow the organisations to engage collaboratively with local people on the design and implementation of new community services and resources.\nData analysis and the tailoring of the app will be supported by the PSUP team on-the-ground in coordination with Planet’s experienced community manager, Elena Fabris. Their aim will be to engage local people and more effectively empower their initiatives utilising digital tools. This participatory approach will allow the slum communities to evolve according to local priorities and with a high degree of community ownership.\nGiovanni Savio, Chief Executive Officer at Planet Smart City, said: “We have built our company on two core beliefs: the fundamental right of every person to an inclusive, safe and sustainable home, and the conviction that through the adequate scale, smart technology, digitalisation, resilient infrastructure and intelligent urban planning we can make this a reality. From Brazil to Italy to India, we have not only developed innovative ways to benefit the lives of our residents, we have learnt from them about how better to engage and empower local voices in a process of continual improvement. \n“It is incredibly exciting to put our learnings to use with UN-Habitat in the service of communities for whom our innovations and expertise can have a transformational effect. With African cities growing by 40,000 people every single day, the need for safe, comfortable and affordable homes is pressing. As we continue to build insights into the rich communities and complex challenges across the continent, we hope to expand the services we can offer people in its many diverse nations.” \nAlan Marcus, Chief Digital Strategy Officer at Planet Smart City, said: “Africa is in the midst of one of the world’s most exciting technological metamorphosis, with Kenya right at the heart. The country is already the world leader for mobile money penetration and connection to mobile services has surged from 30 per cent of the population in 2009 to over 50 per cent last year.* The forces of innovation that are transforming lives in both Kenya and across the continent can be harnessed to empower the people of African nations. \n“All of us at Planet are energised by the prospect of working with UN-Habitat  to ensure this digital revolution in Africa is an inclusive one. Slum communities are tight knit, resourceful and brimming with potential—if we give them the tools, these communities can be the catalysts for real and long-term transformation.”  \nKerstin Sommer, Manager of the Participatory Slum Upgrading Programme of UN-Habitat, said: “With the COVID-19 momentum, we all need to play a part for a bigger mission to improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable in our cities. That won’t work without the contribution of the private sector.”\n*GSMA, March 2020\n \nPress Contacts \nJanaína Campoy\nj.campoy@planetsmartcity.com\n+44 (20) 7887-4525\n \nAndrew Leach / Lucy Wollam \nplanetsmartcity@hudsonsandler.com\n+44 (20) 7796 4133\n \nSusannah Price\nsusannah.price@un.org\nMobile number +254 722 719867\n \nAbout Planet Smart City \nProptech company Planet Smart City designs and builds smart, afordable neighbourhoods that provide more than just homes.

The lectures feature renowned experts discussing cutting-edge research and practical recommendations on advancing urban sustainability and the Sustainable Development Goals in cities. Season 6 consists of 10 lectures.\n \nIn this lecture Roberto Rocco from the Delft University of Technology discusses how the Tragedy of the Commons - how people often use resources to their advantage without considering the good of society as a whole - relates to social sustainability and spatial justice, and how this can contribute to real sustainability in urban development.\n \nDownload audio\n \nSYNOPSIS\nIssues which the lecture addresses\nThe social sustainability of urban development solutions is often overlooked in favour of economic and/or environmental sustainability. This lecture brings together two areas of study that are generally separate: sustainability and socio-spatial justice. It does so by using Hardin's Tragedy of the Commons to illustrate the issues at hand, especially issues of justice, redistribution, and most specially, democracy and participation in decision making. It does so by using literature by Elinor Ostrom, Susan Fainstein and Patsu Healey on the communicative turn in planning. \n \nShort analysis of the above issues \nThe tragedy of the commons unveils crucial environmental and social impacts of the rational pursuit of self-interest by economic actors, and exposes the tragedy of resource exhaustion if self-interest is pursued mindlessly and free of societal control. It also reveals the challenges surrounding the just redistribution of the fruits of human activity, and how this redistribution is decided. These challenges are discussed through the lenses of Ostrom’s theories on the governance of the commons and Fainstein’s propositions on the just city. These two authors are used here to illuminate how the injustices built into the tragedy of the commons can and are customarily solved through communicative rationality and public justification. Finally, Healey’s ideas on the communicative turn in spatial planning are brought in to bridge Ostrom’s and Fainstein’s ideas into spatial planning theory. It concludes by stating that despite the obvious challenges presented by powerful interests overriding the conditions for spatial justice in the city, there is still great potential in systems of public justification and reasoning to pursue just outcomes in the distribution of spatial benefits and burdens of urban development.\n \nPropositions for addressing the issue\n1. Introduction of the Tragedy of the Commons\n2. Introduction of a socially sensitive notion of sustainability\n3. Discussion on the issue of justice and redistribution of resources and the connection with space and urban development\n4. Introduction of the notion of spatial justice as bedrock for social sustainability\n5. Discussion on how resources are redistributed (distributive justice) and how this is decided upon (procedural justice) and how these notions can be used by policy makers when designing policy. \n \nBIOGRAPHY\nRoberto Rocco is a scholar committed to understanding the relationships between society and the production and governance of the built environment. This means that he investigates how actors and institutions from the public sector, the private sector and civic society interact in planning, designing, governing and inhabiting the built environment, both formally and informally. These basic but foundational ideas explain much of his actions as an educator and researcher at the Delft University of Technology. At TU Delft, he is responsible for course development and coordination in the areas of research methodology in areas of planning and design practice, regional planning and design, governance and sustainability. He leads the TU Delft Summer School Planning and Design with Water, a summer school for 100 students mostly from the Global South in which they explore how to make cities resilient to climate change through water sensitive urban planning and design. He has taken part in several MOOCs and coordinated the Spatial Justice module of the MOOC RETHINK THE CITY.\n \nADDITIONAL READING MATERIAL\nHardin, G. (1968). The Tragedy of the Commons.

{"organization": "United Nations", "category": "", "crawlTime": "2020-10-21", "title": "UN-Habitat concludes a Webinar on Landfill Remediation towards adoption of Fukuoka Method in India", "issueAgency": "United Nations Human Settlements Programme", "issueTime": "4 August 2020", "detail": "New Delhi, 29 July 2020 – Across the developing world, open dumping sites have been a major concern due to the environment, health and livelihood hazard that such sites cause. Most of the so-called landfill sites that exist in India are usually dumping grounds which were originally low-lying areas and waste was used to fill them, thus the name ‘land-fill’. These dumping grounds are sites that cause excessive ground water pollution, methane gas emissions, fire-hazards and pests—something that is completely opposite to a scientific landfill site.\n“Sound landfill management” is the need of the hour as it minimizes risks to public health and the environment, leads to clean and resilient cities, contributes to improving resource efficiency, transition to a circular economy, and promotes innovation, employment and sustainable economic growth. This was the crucial consensus by panelists and about 94 participants from local governments, state urban departments and other bilateral and UN agencies who attended the webinar on Landfill Remediation: Exploring Opportunities for adoption of Fukuoka Method in Indian Cities organised by UN-Habitat in coordination with its Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific (ROAP) on 29 July 2020.\n“Fukuoka Method is a low-cost sustainable intervention on landfill remediation that intends to remediate dumpsites/landfills by utilising low cost technologies and resource materials. We feel, that the Fukuoka Method shall be extremely useful for the Indian context where remediation is also about using local resources, emphasising on segregation, recover recyclables and provide jobs to informal sector,” said Mr. Srinivasa Popuri, Senior Human Settlement Officer, ROAP, UN-Habitat, in his opening remarks.\n“UN-Habitat ROAP is working closely on this issue with experts since late 90s. We had the chance to collaborate and work with Fukuoka Method founders and have done pilot interventions in Ethiopia, Kenya and Myanmar amongst other countries. We intend to transfer the knowledge of this method to Indian cities,” Mr. Popuri added.\nDr. Prashant Gargava, Member Secretary, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) highlighted the need for resource intensive landfill site remediation in India in his keynote address. “India has been traditionally following the minimization, recycle and reuse paradigm since ages, our per capita waste generation is much lower in comparison to other countries, however, we started late on waste management as compared to other countries, hence, the challenges still remain particularly in the area of processing where in only 1/3rd of the total waste generated (roughly 150,000 tonnes per day) gets processed, 1/3rd goes to scientific landfill sites and remaining 1/3rd is still being disposed openly in dumpsites. Additionally, there are over 3,000 legacy waste dumpsites that needs to be taken care of,” added Dr. Gargava.\nMs. Pooja Varma, Urban and Governance Expert, UN-Habitat  presented the ongoing interventions of UN-Habitat India office under the Sustainable Cities: Integrated Approach Pilot (SCIAP) Project in 5 cities – Bhopal, Mysuru, Jaipur, Guntur and Vijayawada.\nMs. Swati Singh Sambyal, Waste Management Specialist, UN-Habitat  shared about the existing status of landfills and dumpsites in India. “As per CPCB’s data on dumpsites, India still has 3,159 operational dumpsites. Uttar Pradesh tops the charts, with 609 dumpsites, followed by Madhya Pradesh, with 378, and Maharashtra, with 327 dumpsites. Landfill capping and biomining are two possible solutions for managing dumpsites currently being explored in the country. However, many municipalities lack the budgets to opt for remediation of their dumpsites due to high capital and operational costs,” added Ms. Sambyal.\nDr. Matsufuji Yasushi, Professor Emeritus, Fukuoka University, Japan, also one of the founders of Fukuoka Method introduced the semi-aerobic landfill concept to participants and explained the interventions adopted in Japan (the technology has been adopted by over 80 per cent of local governments) and over 15 countries worldwide.\nSemi-aerobic landfill structure (Fukuoka Method) refers to a mechanism whereby leachate is quickly removed from waste materials, allowing the inflow of air by installing perforated collection pipes and vertical perforated gas venting pipes at the bottom of the landfill. As the outlet of the perforated collection pipe is always open to air, by using internal fermentation heat, air flows naturally, without the need for an external energy source. By maintaining aerobic conditions in the waste bed interior, the Fukuoka Method accelerates the decomposition of waste materials, improves leachate water quality and inhibits the emission of methane gas. “Local governments in developing countries do not have sufficient funds and this technology provides a cost-effective SWM solution. Leachate treatment via adoption of this method is also very simplified through biological treatment followed by chemical processing. This method is also environmentally friendly (UNFCC approved in 2011) and reduces methane emissions,” Professor Matsufuji added.\n“The Fukuoka Method is very scientific, and the economics of the technology can be worked around depending on the capacity and resources available to local governments. One of the other advantages is that it can be introduced at any stage of landfilling – be it a new or existing landfill. It can even be used to convert a 50-year old completed site into a sanitary landfill,” said Ms. Sachiyo Hoshino, Special Advisor to the Director, Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, UN-Habitat.\n“We have also been successful in adapting the technology in all types of weather conditions – be it in the dry, arid desert climate of Iran or hot and humid climes Malaysia. It has also succeeded in Bangladesh and Pakistan, which have weather conditions similar to India,” Ms. Hoshino added.\nThe presentations were followed by a Q&A session, where municipalities and local authorities’ representatives asked questions on the feasibility of adoption of Fukuoka Method in India, its economic viability and the time frame this method takes to treat dump sites.  Majority of the city authorities found that the Fukuoka Method would be quite useful for adoption in Indian cities based on an online poll during the Webinar.\nMs. Sachiyo Hoshino, in her closing remarks, thanked the participants for an interactive session and explained the further steps that UN-Habitat shall adopt to take this pilot intervention forward in India which shall involve coordination with specific cities in India to understand the country specific context and challenges and work with city municipalities for handover of technology. \nTo take this intervention forward, UN-Habitat India shall discuss with the 5 SCIAP cities about steps to take the pilot intervention forward.\nFull recording of the Webinar can be accessed at UN-Habitat India official YouTube Channel at: https://youtu.be/aJQC_krOvss\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-concludes-a-webinar-on-landfill-remediation-towards-adoption-of-fukuoka-method-in-india", "abstract": "New Delhi, 29 July 2020 – Across the developing world, open dumping sites have been a major concern ..."},

The resulting document of May 2019 recognised the need for a United Nations system-wide approach to urban data management, that would align protocols for data sharing at the global level.\nIn focused sessions of the EGM, representatives from Madrid, New York, Los Angeles, Durban, Helsinki, Mannheim, Qassim, Bogota and Buenos Aires detailed the specific monitoring needs and challenges of cities from different contexts. United Nations Agencies including UN Women, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNESCO, UNGSII and UNODC along with all UN Regional Economic Commissions shared information on urban data collection methods and the importance of inclusion of relevant dimensions in the framework.\nLikewise, Citibanamex, CitiIQ, ThinkCity, and ITU explained existing methodologies of city data measurement frameworks to be integrated into the framework for greater cohesion and standardization.  In open discussions, participants explored the approaches to urban data management and aligning protocols for data sharing at the global level.\nIn the final discussions of the meeting, various organisations like the OECD, UNICEF and others announced their commitment and support for the ongoing process for the development of the Framework. There was a powerful pledge from Shanghai to fully support UN-Habitat and the SDG Cities Flagship Programme in carrying out joined-up research for the development of an Index and an Award which will recognize cities for their urban sustainable development practices, and to develop a Voluntary Local Review showcasing Shanghai’s advancement in the local implementation of the SDGs.\nThe meeting concluded with the agreement to arrange a  Joint Urban Monitoring Group to further develop and finalise the monitoring framework which will be submitted to the United Nations Statistical Commission for its consideration at the Commission’s 52nd session in March of 2021.\nThe development and adoption of a UN System-Wide Urban Monitoring Framework represents a significant step for the support to Local and Regional Governments and stakeholders in the elaboration of Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs), further strengthening the links between the national and local monitoring and reporting processes for the implementation of the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. Through an effort to provide coherence and continuity to the support to subnational monitoring processes, the results of this Expert Group Meeting (EGM) will feed into the wider work of UN-Habitat on VLRs and specifically into the discussion of an EGM dedicated to VLRs that UN-Habitat will host in December 2020 in collaboration with Madrid City Council.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-leads-the-collaborative-development-of-the-united-nations-system-wide-urban-monitoring", "abstract": "Madrid, 12 August 2020- Over 100 urban experts from the United Nations system, academia, city leader..."},

He remained in the park with his wife and six five children during the city’s occupation by the militant ISIL group and took in his brother’s daughter when the rest of her family died in the conflict.\n“I have been living for over two decades with my family in a few rooms that I built myself with concrete blocks. We did not have running water or a proper toilet. I had very little money,” Mr. Suliman said. “It was a space that only animals could live in. Every year, in spring, we were suffering from floods that destroyed most of our belongings. I always dreamt of living in a proper house.”\nAl-Yarmouk Park had not been maintained for nearly a decade and was full of rubbish, benches had been stolen and trees cut down for fuel. UN-Habitat started rehabilitating the park in late 2019 creating over 200 jobs for skilled and unskilled workers from the surrounding area, including female workers. The project, funded by the EU, includes new sports facilities, playgrounds, a community hall, a new irrigation and lighting system, and an intense horticulture training programme, targeting unemployed female residents, which will include planting of hundreds of trees and bushes.\nMr Suliman thought he would be evicted but instead UN-Habitat reached an agreement with the Municipality to assign him as one of the park guards and provide him with a prefabricated house on higher and safer ground.\n“Many residents of the area are now passing by and congratulating me for my new house and feeling happy for me,” he beamed, sitting with his children in the doorway of his new home.\n “I will be taking care of the park as my home and family” said Mr. Suliman who is already taking care of the plants and has been occasionally hired as an unskilled worker by the contractors working on site. “This project has not yet been completed but it has already changed my life. I feel I can now provide a better future for my family.”\nUN-Habitat has adopted strict preventive measures for all construction site workers and supervisors including physical distancing, mandatory wearing of face masks and gloves, measuring body temperatures and frequent hand washing. Contractors were instructed to hire skilled and unskilled workers among unemployed residents of the target areas allowing the job to be done more quickly and supporting local livelihoods.\nProviding jobs and income at the height of the economic crisis triggered by the pandemic is key to help conflicted-affected urban communities in their recovery and is considered a key priority  during the four-year-long EU-funded programme Supporting Recovery and Stability in Iraq through Local Development implemented by UNDP in partnership with UN-Habitat.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/park-squatter-in-mosul-iraq-offered-new-opportunity-thanks-to-un-habitat-rehabilitation-project", "abstract": "Mosul, Iraq, August 2020 – After squatting in Al-Yarmouk Park in Mosul, northern Iraq, for 22 years,..."},

It is against this background that UN-Habitat and partners are soon launching a multisectoral guide to support local authorities on migrants’ inclusion at local level. \nThe Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) and the Global Compact for Refugees (GCR) were adopted in December 2018 by most of the UN Member States. Both global frameworks acknowledged the importance of local authorities for implementing and achieving the set objectives. Cities have long played a central role for accommodating and including migrants and are now playing an active role on migration topics in cooperation with national governments, the international community and in partnership with civil society and private sector actors. However, while some local authorities are successfully developing and implementing innovative strategies, others struggle and are in need of guidance, resources and capacity to advance with challenges regarding service provision and inclusion of migrants, refugees, returnees and displaced persons into their urban societies.\nIn 2019, UN-Habitat joined forces with the Center for Mediterranean Integration (CMI), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Conference for Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organization (UNESCO), and the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) to collectively support local authorities in reaching the goals and objectives set out in the two Global Compacts, with a special focus on migrants’ inclusion through local actions and multi-sectorial approaches. The aim of the cooperation is to provide cross-sectoral recommendations emphasizing cities’ growing importance for sustainable migrant inclusion and harnessing the positive impact of migrants’ social and economic inclusion in cities.\nBefore the official launch of the report titled “Local Inclusion of Migrants and Refugees - A gateway to existing ideas, resources and capacities for cities across the world”, the multi-partner group reached out to selected local authorities for feedback on the recommendations and practicability. The survey was conducted in four languages (English, French, Spanish and Arabic) and was shared with local authorities in different regions and cities, including capitals, but also small and intermediate cities. Local authorities were asked to rate the relevance and implementability of each recommendation and provide comments. Recommendations covered topics such as governance, urban and territorial planning, local economic development and entrepreneurship, human rights, protection of children and provision of health services).\nIn addition to the rating, local authorities were also asked to name further areas of support needed to implement the recommendations (e.g. technical advisory services, training and capacity building among others). One final question covered local actions and assumptions on the impact of COVID-19 on the migrant community and other vulnerable groups and the ability of local authorities for further actions. Additional survey results can be found here.\nThe survey results underlined the need for policy coherence, multi-level and multi-sectoral coordination for a reactive, multidimensional, sustainable and effective response to migration related topics in urban settings. Based on consultations with local authorities as main audience for the guide and the survey results, the report will now be finalized, offering concrete examples and strategies for local actions and effective, transformative change at the local level and officially launched in the fourth quarter of 2020. \n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-and-partners-set-to-launch-a-multisectoral-guide-to-support-local-authorities-on", "abstract": "Nairobi, 13 August 2020 - A recent survey among local authorities reveals that cross-sectoral thinki..."},

The stations have resulted in 1.5 million handwashes.\nLocal leaders praised the involvement of the youth in combating COVID-19 and operating the hand washing stations have been operating seven days a week.\nThe celebration marked the launch of distribution of free masks. Through funding provided by the Kenyan footballer Victor Wanyama’s Foundation, UN-Habitat is working with women from the informal settlements to make the masks. This creates employment and provides masks for residents.\nCynthia Wanyama, the CEO of The Victor Wanyama Foundation stated the international footballer came from an informal settlement and wanted to be part of the efforts to combat the pandemic.\nDuring the event, awards were presented to youth for exemplary efforts in areas such as creative ideas, hospitality, reaching out to the sick and vulnerable.  \n‘If we cannot appreciate ourselves, nobody will appreciate us’, said Moses Omondi, coordinator of the Kibera Community Emergency Response Team, co-convener of the Youth-led COVID-19 Emergency Response Coaltion.\n‘I didn’t know one day someone will recognize our efforts, we were going through our daily routine by sourcing sanitary towels and distributing to the girls in the slums,’ said Susan Mweni, of the Making A Difference Sisters, one of the winners.\nUN-Habitat’s George Gachie said that working with youth was part of UN-Habitat’s mandate and they were determined to make the youth voice count.\nIn a statement, the youth Coalition made an urgent appeal to government, the private sector, UN agencies, and the diplomatic community to continue to support and expand the hand washing stations, provide food to the needy, produce masks  made by women in the community, establish isolation centres, and expand education programmes and arts, such as murals to raise awareness of the virus.

The Summit was endorsed by UN 75, a global dialogue launched by the UN to listen to people across the world, especially youth.\n\"Our youth have played very important roles in emergency interventions against the COVID-19 pandemic in our country,” stated Murat Kurum, Minister of Environment and Urbanization, Government of Turkey, “Thousands of our youth, together with all our institutions, voluntarily provided all the needs of people aged 65 and over or citizens with chronic diseases who were prohibited or restricted from going out under COVID19 measures. Our youth are always the guarantee of our future, our countries.”\nYouth-led organizations globally have worked with local and national governments, leading efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19. In Kenya, handwashing facilities set up in informal settlements and run by the youth were popular among local residents.\nThe Executive Director of UN-Habitat, Maimunah Mohd Sharif, said the facilities were set up after youth from the Mathare Environmental One Stop Centre in one of Nairobi’s informal settlements approached her with an urgent call.\n“The youth said something needed to be done immediately to stop COVID-19 in informal settlements, and we have an idea on what we can do,” said Ms. Sharif, “Five months later we see the results. We have activated our One Stop Centres in Kenya and Somalia and taken joint action which has seen 1.5 million hands washed, slowed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”\nThe quick action of Mathare Environmental inspired spread the youth communities in Kenya, Somalia, Liberia and Ecuador, and by April, 34 youth-led groups had set up COVID-19 prevention and hand washing stations, supported by UN-Habitat and partners from the governmental, non-profit and private sector. The stations provide a range of public health responses such as murals to promote COVID-19 prevention, the distribution of masks, and the promotion of sustainable livelihoods.\n“Many young people have come to realize that COVID-19 is not only a health issue, but it effects every area of our livelihood, every aspect of our community and our social life” said Gwendolyn Myers,  Liberian National Youth Task Force, “Since the outbreak in Liberia of March 2020 we have noticed an imbalanced effect on certain groups of people, women and children and people with disabilities. Young people continue to play critical roles in information dissemination, logistics and the distribution of relief materials to these communities.”\nOne key aspect of the meeting focused on the need to empower communities to take action, as reflected in UN-Habitat’s COVID-19 Response Plan.\n“One of the three focuses of our Response Plan is the support of local government and community driven solutions, especially in informal settlements,” said UN-Habitat’s Executive Director.\n“Many youth of today have stepped up to the plate. Young people are redefining the world as we know it. Youth are demanding the change you want to see from leaders,” stated Under-Secretary-General Fabrizio Hochschild Drummond, Special Adviser on the United Nations 75th Anniversary. “We are seeing it across the globe - youth are making their voices heard. You are creating movements that ripple across cultures and borders. You are taking the future into your own hands and ensuring that progress happens.”                                         \nOne of the main sponsors of the youth-led action against the virus has been the Government of Canada, which is funding COVID-19 prevention and hand washing stations in Nairobi and Mandera in Kenya, and Kismayo in Somalia.\n“Canada believes in the strength of young people and their power to create positive change. This is one of the reasons we are so proud to support initiatives that empower young men and women to play a meaningful role in community-led pandemic responses,” stated Canadian High Commissioner to Kenya, Lisa Stadelbauer.\n“We’re proud and honoured to work with UN-Habitat to partner with youth-led Community-Based Organizations such as the Mandera Anti Drug Movement,  Mathare Environmental One Stop and YPEER-Somalia through our Canada Fund for Local Initiative programme.”\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/youth-in-informal-settlements-take-the-lead-on-fight-against-the-spread-of-covid-19", "abstract": "12 August 2020 - The 20th anniversary of International Youth Day featured the Youth, COVID-19 and In..."},
