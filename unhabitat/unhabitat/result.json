The event, jointly organized by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) and UN-Habitat marked another milestone of the collaboration between the two agencies on the topic.\nThe event brought together high-level technical experts to discuss the renewed urgency of addressing homelessness within the context of a COVID-19 new normal.\nDuring the event, Mr. Robert Lewis-Lettington, Chief of UN-Habitat’s Land, Housing and Shelter section, highlight the fact that “as the United Nations we must respect, protect and fulfil the rights of the most vulnerable. People experiencing homelessness are amongst them. If we want to make our cities sustainable and inclusive, we must address homelessness”.\nAt the end of his remarks, he launched the new UN-Habitat Proceedings Report of the 2019 Expert Group Meeting on “Affordable housing and social protection systems for all to address homelessness” that took place in Nairobi 22 - 24 May 2019. The report collects and analyses the contribution of the experts who participated in the EGM and aims to broaden the understanding of the complex causes of homelessness.\nMs. Daniela Bas, Director of the Division for Inclusive Social Development of UN DESA, further stressed during the meeting the complex and global nature of homelessness and how, she says, “it affects people from different ages, geographical areas and backgrounds and this has become increasingly visible today with the COVID19 pandemic”. According to Daniela Bas, “we must build on the strong political will and the actions that have been taken to address homelessness during the pandemic to recover from the COVID19 crisis and build back better”.\nOther leading voices in the field of homelessness prevention discussed strategies to better map and tackle the root-causes of homelessness and to support government in their effort to end homelessness forever.\nMs. Dame Louise Casey, Chair of the Advisory Committee of Institute of Global Homelessness (IGH), pointed out that “a lot of funds have been spent on developing strategies to solve ‘symptoms’ of homelessness without addressing the root causes of the disease. To address homelessness, we must prevent the recurrence of its driving factors”. She also stressed the importance of data for devising evidence-based and effective policies. On this point, she said “if we do not count homelessness, we do not see homelessness and IGH is committed to partner with any willing stakeholder to conduct a global homelessness survey”.\nMs. Christina Behrendt, Head of ILO’s Social Policy Unit, Social Protection Department, discussed the need to strengthen social protection systems and the delivery of affordable housing to address homelessness, building on the positive initiatives taken by governments globally during the COVID-19 emergency phase. According to Christina Behrendt, during the pandemic “208 countries have improved in different ways their social protection systems, with 131 housing or basic services related measures in 86 different countries”.\nMr. Freek Spinnewijn, Director, European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless (FEANTSA), addressed the issue of harmonizing the definition of homelessness and presented the European Typology of Homelessness and housing exclusion (ETHOS). He said: “the ETHOS definition tries to capture homelessness as a process and its features across different scenarios. ETHOS does not promote hierarchy in gravity within categories of homelessness. It features collateral and indirectly related issues such as asylum and gender-based violence as well as long term solutions”.\nThe webinar also served as a platform for amplifying the voices of those who experienced homelessness. Ms. Liz Madden and Ms. Iris Bailey shared their experiences on what it means to be homelessness and how they overcame this experience. Ms. Madden pointed out that “being given a home was just the first step toward ending her homelessness situation. For many people homelessness is a state of mind that is hard to escape without experts’ support”. Ms. Bailey shared the real-life stories of friends and relatives who were left behind, suffered homelessness and lacked support to change the situation.\nParticipants agreed that homelessness is the result of a structural failure to respect, protect and fulfil human rights. As Ms. Bailey said at the end of the event, “everyone should have the right to say ‘this is my mail and address’, ‘my home’, ‘I am going home’ and ‘I live here’ ”.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/world-homelessness-day-2020-housing-and-social-protection-at-the-core-of-homelessness-prevention", "abstract": "Nairobi, 12 October 2020 – On the occasion of World Homelessness Day, UN-Habitat hosted a webinar on..."},

Today about 80 per cent of the population already lives in cities,\" said the Minister of Public Works, Services and Housing, Iván Arias.\nThis urban policy was developed through a broad and plural participatory process that involved nearly 250 sessions and workshops throughout the country, including two National Urban Forums,  in which more than 7,000 representatives of institutions and organizations participated.\n“For us, it has been very gratifying to be able to support this process for more than two years, supporting Sustainable Development Goal 11 to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. The Cities Policy is also in full alignment with the New Urban Agenda, which was issued in Habitat III and assumed by the Bolivian government,” said the Executive Director of UN-Habitat, Maimunah Mohd Sharif in a video.\nDuring the event, the Vice Minister of Housing and Urban Planning, Vladimir Ameller, symbolically delivered the document of the Cities Policy to the President of the Association of Municipalities of Bolivia (AMB), Rocío Molina, as the municipal governments of the urban centres will lead and implement this initiative.\n“This proposal is a first impulse, a dynamo that will be transferred to the real protagonists, the cities. (The City Policy) is a proposal that respects and deepens the autonomous regime; it is and should be concluded in its implementation stage with, for and from the cities, which are ultimately its reason for being,” the Vice Minister specified.\nRepresentatives of international cooperation, groups and urban entities, as well as departmental and municipal authorities from different cities in Bolivia took part in the event.\nThe Cities Policy is the strategic instrument to guide urban development, which identifies and proposes public policies to address challenges and take advantage of the opportunities posed by the urbanization process to contribute to the diversification of the economy, reduce inequalities and ensure sustainability.\nThe policy is being deployed on three levels: intra-urban, urban-territorial and urban-national. Its objectives are to achieve inclusive, healthy cities with a good quality of life and productive, orderly, sustainable and resilient cities, in addition to the governance of the city.\nThe policy has a timeframe of around 15 years, or three legislative periods, coinciding with the rounds of the Comprehensive Planning System of the State, as well as with the two major milestones in international agendas: the Sustainable Development Agenda of 2030 and the IV Conference of the United Nations on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development of 2036.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/bolivia-presents-its-new-cities-policy-for-urban-development", "abstract": "La Paz, Bolivia, October 7, 2020. – To mark World Habitat Day, Bolivia’s Ministry of Public Works, S..."},

It discusses the idea of decentralised energy production systems in cities and looks at the challenge of waste, energy production and governance in instituting a circular economy. ‘In my backyard!’ Waste and energy in a Circular Economy suggests a system of nested scales to bring the point of disposal of waste and decentralised energy generation as close as possible to the point of waste generation.\n \nShort analysis of the above issues \nThe case study and findings of the benefits of a system of waste disposal and energy generation through nested scales – the ‘In my Backyard! Paradigm - is based upon case study research of solid waste processes and practices involving bio-gas generation instituted in one ward of the city of Kochi, Kerala, India.\n \nPropositions for addressing the issue\n Angelique builds up her analysis from:\na) The widely accepted idea of the waste hierarchy;\nb) The issues involved in a centralised collection and disposal of waste currently adopted in most cities across the world;\nc) The idea of ‘zero-waste’ cities and the ‘circular economy’;\nd) The case for decentralised systems of energy and e) the need for nested scales of waste – to – energy and waste – to – material systems.

Globally, more than 60 percent of refugees and 80 percent of internally displaced people reside in urban areas, even though numbers in the East African region vary, due to a lesser level of urbanization in the region in general.\nThe session started with an introduction by the co-host, UNHCR’s Senior Livelihoods and Economic Inclusion Officer in the Regional Bureau for East, the Horn and the Great Lakes, Ms Anna Gaunt, presenting the official numbers of refugees and asylum seekers in urban areas in the region. Stephanie Loose from UN-Habitat then highlighted UN-Habitat’s mandate and general approaches for supporting people in vulnerable situations in urban areas UN-Habitat’s mandate and general approaches for supporting people in vulnerable situations in urban areas. Being the UN agency aiming to advance sustainable urbanization as a driver of development and peace to improve living conditions for all, UN-Habitat underlined its area-based, multi-stakeholder and multi-level governance approaches, and highlighted inclusive participatory processes as one means for enabling the social and economic inclusion of refugees into urban societies and its aim to improve urban systems, that benefit both host and refugee/displaced communities. \nThose approaches have been applied in different urban contexts in the East African region, and UN-Habitat’s Somalia team, represented by Mr Matthew Flynn, then presented how they are translated in urban displacement contexts, starting with a multi-sectoral, spatial data analysis of the urban areas (“urban profiling”) to inclusion of local actors, including government authorities, civil society and private sectors and beneficiaries in participatory planning processes for agreeing on priorities for actions. Spatial planning led to better access to basic and urban services and helped to improve urban environments.\nLack of adequate housing was identified which then led to the development of large housing project, which, due to its rental schemes, will also lead to increased, long-term increase in local revenue which can be used for further investments in the areas.\nMr Flynn also shortly introduced the recently launched “Settlement profiling tool[1]”, a joint tool developed by UN-Habitat and UNHCR, which will be presented in the Regional Economic Inclusion group in December.\n“Reducing vulnerabilities of migrants, displaced and refugees residing in urban areas needs cross-sectoral coordination. Specifically in urban contexts, there needs to be an urban-system and integrated approach, to make sure that interventions benefit people in vulnerable situations communities from both host and refugee communities”, he said.\nThe second part of the session started with a presentation by AGORA, an initiative that promotes efficient, inclusive and integrated local planning, aid response and service delivery in areas affected by crisis. Ms Louise Thaller from AGORA introduced an urban assessment of Kampala, Uganda. AGORA advocates for multi-sector recovery needs and localizes response planning and aid delivery beyond sector specific approaches and stands up for technical support for local actors that lead to tangible results and foster collaboration between exogenous aid actors, local stakeholders and public authorities. The Kampala Urban Assessment (2018) showcased the relationships between needs, area of residence and displacement status – highlighting the interdependence of those factors and underlining that in many cases, not the legal status, but gender had more impact on vulnerability.\nThe session was concluded by a presentation on UNHCR’s initiatives for fostering market access for products produced by refugees, MADE51 and Bawa Hope. MADE51 is an innovative, market-based model that promotes economic inclusion of refugees in global value chains. In the MADE51 model, UNHCR identifies refugees with artisanal skills, helps refugees create strong artisan groups and connects these groups to experienced local social enterprise partners.  MADE51 is also a tangible way to demonstrate solidarity with refugees while helping refugees earn valuable income while Bawa Hope is a Fair-Trade company which works with marginalized handicraft artisans in Kenya\nThe session brought together different approaches for fostering economic inclusion of migrants, refugees and displaced persons in urban areas, and highlighting that urban displacement needs tailored, multi-sectoral approaches that include local actors and respond to specific local contexts as well as creating enabling environments for refugees and displaced to become self-reliant and live dignified lives.\n \n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/unhcr-and-un-habitat-co-moderate-%E2%80%9Crefugees-and-asylum-seekers-in-urban-areas%E2%80%9D-session", "abstract": "Nairobi 7 October 2020--Within the framework of UNHCR and NRC's’ monthly East and Horn of African Re..."},

Attendees included members of Garissa County Assembly Lands Committee, Dadaab and Fafi Sub-Counties, UNHCR and UN-Habitat.\nAs the first phase of developing the Advisory Strategy for the Regeneration of Ifo 2 and Kambioos, a project funded by the European Union Trust Fund, UN-Habitat has been carrying out a comprehensive spatial assessment of the two camps within the sub-county, county and national contexts. The assessment is helping to inform a profile of the area which both describes and analyses the camps through an urban planning lens with the aim of establishing an evidence base that will be used to develop future interventions and guide future investment.\nThe purpose of the workshop was to present the findings of the spatial assessment that UN-Habitat has developed so far and receive feedback from the stakeholders. Additionally, a preliminary planning session was carried out to consider the opportunities and challenges that the decommissioned sites present which stimulated lively discussion and constructive action points for further exploration as the planning process gathers momentum. Garissa County Executive Member for Trade, Tourism and Enterprise Development Mr. Adow Kalil Jubat called on participants to contribute tangible ideas in order to create a sustainable development plan that will benefit local communities.\nThe morning session of the workshop comprised presentations by UN-Habitat on the key messages taken from the spatial assessments, followed by feedback and discussion. In the afternoon session, participants broke off into groups to prepare SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analyses of Ifo 2 and Kambioos camps.\nWhile various threats and weaknesses were identified for both camps, there was great emphasis on the opportunities the camps presented. These opportunities spanned a wide range of themes including the agricultural potential of existing green belts and orchards, the educational potential of Ifo 2’s underutilized school facilities, the climatic opportunities of harvesting rainwater and solar energy and the economic opportunities of encouraging new small businesses and industries such as bee-keeping in Ifo 2  and bottling of borehole water in Kambioos.\nThe workshop concluded with discussion of the take-aways and next steps of the project, with emphasis on additional stakeholder engagement which will be undertaken with the support of Garissa County and UNHCR.\nThe stakeholder workshop was an especially vital component of the project, particularly as COVID-19 has placed limitations upon-the-ground data gathering and fieldwork that was initially planned for this project. In response to travel limitations, UN-Habitat has been remotely developing and digitizing new spatial data which, in addition to contributing to the Ifo 2 and Kambioos spatial profile development, will have the added benefit of providing Garissa County and development agencies with a more extensive database of spatial information in the future. This is due to be developed and validated as part of the field survey due to kick off imminently.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-and-garissa-county-hold-stakeholder-workshop-on-decommissioned-refugee-settlements", "abstract": "Garissa Town, Kenya 8 October 2020 - UN-Habitat, in collaboration with the County Government of Gari..."},

The four-hour workshop shared the outcomes of previous workshops, presented and discussed the impacts of COVID-19 in each country and proposed way forward for the project aiming to address issues arising from the pandemic by strengthening urban-rural linkages.\nMr. Barr Mukhtar Nasale, the Commissioner of the Ministry of Land and Housing of Niger State, delivered welcome remarks and expressed the State’s commitment to the implementation of the project. Mr. Mohammad Habib, Director of Department of Urban and Rural Planning Commission for Lands, Zanzibar and Mr. Makame A. Muhajir, Urban Policy consultant from Zanzibar showed their appreciation for UN-Habitat’s continuous support for the promotion of Urban-Rural Linkages in Zanzibar.\nThe outcomes of a previous workshop that took place in Zanzibar in 2019 were presented, including the relevant Urban-Rural Linkages Guiding Principles identified in each country and the challenges hindering the connectivity and flow of resources and services between urban and rural areas. Recommendations to overcome the identified challenges were as well identified by participants.\nThe teams from both the Niger State  and  Zanzibar  also presented the challenges they’ve faced during the pandemic across the urban-rural continuum. Niger State has suffered from a drastic decline in rural investment and the disruption of food supply chains due to restrictions on mobility.  Dr. Abdul Husaini further introduced the inadequate access to medical facilities and limited humanitarian access in rural areas. In Zanzibar, the pandemic has exposed the issue of lack of ICT facilities in rural areas, affecting governmental services, and impacting education services.  As a country whose economy heavily depends on its tourism industry, the drastic decline of tourists has taken a toll on the income of many. It was also signaled that the pandemic reduced rural to urban migration, slowing down the urbanization process in Zanzibar.\nAfter the presentations, both teams were given the time to discuss possible activities to accommodate COVID-19 crisis and revised action plan, as well as to identify pilot projects. Zanzibar identified improving rural infrastructure, produce storage and transportation and ICT facilities as their priorities. Niger State proposed possible pilot projects in sustaining the supply chain of agricultural produce and strengthening rural healthcare system. The importance of engaging rural communities in the planning process was also highlighted. As a conclusion, participants asserted the importance of multi-stakeholder, multi-sector, multi-level interventions and engagement for strengthened urban-rural linkages so no one and no place will be left behind.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/virtual-regional-workshop-on-implementing-urban-rural-linkages-during-covid-19-pandemic", "abstract": "Nairobi, 15 October 2020 - UN-Habitat successfully held the virtual workshop “Implementing the UNDA ..."},

The Roundtable looked at challenges and solutions connected to the theme of World Habitat Day -  Housing for All: A Better Urban Future.\nThe Roundtable was also part of the Housing4All Campaign, launched by UN-Habitat on World Habitat Day, to raise awareness on the crucial role of adequate housing to development, gather solutions to address current gaps and call on all stakeholders to share responsibility in ensuring adequate housing for all.\nThe panel brought together partners from local and national governments, private sector, civil society, research, and financial institutions and was moderated by Shipra Narang Suri, Chief of UN-Habitat Urban Practices Branch. She highlighted how COVID-19 has been the biggest advertisement for adequate housing, and for collaborative action towards housing for all.\n“At a time when universal access to adequate housing is a frontline defence against the coronavirus, nearly 1.8 billion people live in overcrowded or inadequate housing, slums and slum-like conditions, or in a state of homeless­ness, with acute risks of exposure. The pandemic has shown how deeply housing relates to people and communities’ health, dignity, wellbeing, inclusion and safety,” she said.\nThe Undersecretary for Multilateral Affairs and Human Right, Mexico, and President of the UN-Habitat Assembly Martha Delgado reiterated the role of housing in the overall realization of Economic Social and Cultural Rights and people’s wellbeing.\nThe Senior Advisor for the Directorate for Housing, Urban Development and Landscapes of the Government of France, Yves-Laurent Sapoval, highlighted that COVID-19 has shed light on pre-existing housing inequalities.\n“Quality of housing has massive impacts on everyone’s quality of life including family relationships, conflicts, work capacity and education. We should rethink the links between housing, work, public transportation and urban amenities” he said.\nThis was reiterated by Anacláudia Marinheiro Centeno Rossbach, Regional Manager for Latin America and Caribbean of Cities Alliance who stated that fiscal resources should be allocated to improvement of housing conditions and in-situ slum upgrading.

The Roundtable deepened the discussion around the theme of World Habitat Day, Housing for All: A Better Urban Future.\nThe panel which brought together partners from local and national governments, private sector, civil society, research, and financial institutions was moderated by Shipra Narang Suri, Chief of UN-Habitat Urban Practices Branch in UN-Habitat. She highlighted how COVID-19 has been the biggest advertisement for adequate housing, and for collaborative action towards housing for all. \n“At a time when universal access to adequate housing is a frontline defence against the coronavirus, nearly 1.8 billion people live in overcrowded or inadequate housing, slums and slum-like conditions, or in a state of homeless­ness, with acute risks of exposure. The pandemic has shown how deeply housing relates to people and communities’ health, dignity, wellbeing, inclusion and safety,” she said.\nAfter sharing challenges and opportunities emerging from the COVID-19 crisis, participants agreed on a set of key recommendations for the promotion and protection of the right to adequate housing in the COVID-19 recovery and post-recovery phase. Participants generally recommended that housing be clearly acknowledged as a fundamental human right and called for governments to prioritize the social function of housing and land by, among other actions, preventing over-speculation on housing assets. This could be done by strengthening regulation on real estate markets and via tax laws that prevent speculation on land and housing.\nParticipants also called for the rental social housing sectors to be strengthened and further developed with an increased public investment in social housing, specifically low-income housing. They also said there was a need to coordinate, cooperate and collaborate among all global housing stakeholder to find innovative and out of the box solutions to housing challenges and maximise efforts.\nPreventing forced evictions and mitigating the social and economic drawback of evictions were other key recommendations. Participants said it was essential to ensure the security of tenure for all especially in informal settlements, including by providing incremental in-situ upgrading and finally they said that self-construction methodologies should be developed to reduce costs and environmental footprint using simple, culturally adequate and standardised structural housing elements.\nClosing the meeting, Shipra Narang Suri of UN-Habitat committed the agency to drawing from the insights shared during the meeting to propose a renewed framework for cooperation, coordination and collaboration among all housing stakeholders to maximize efforts and fully realize the right to adequate housing for everyone and leave no one behind.\nParticipants in the roundtable included Martha Delgado, Undersecretary for Multilateral Affairs and Human Rights, Government of Mexico; Yves-Laurent Sapoval, Senior Advisor for the Directorate for Housing, Urban Development and Landscapes, Government of France; Anacláudia Marinheiro Centeno Rossbach, Regional Manager for Latin America and Caribbean, Cities Alliance;  Grzegorz Gajda, Senior Housing Specialist, European Investment Bank; Marissa Plouin, Specialist of the OECD Directorate for Employment, Labour and Social Affairs; Danielle Grossenbacher.

Abdihakim Osman, the UN-Habitat JPLG Project Officer said that this model was adopted as it is an effective and sustainable way of ensuring that public institutions are empowered to respond to the emerging needs of their fellow citizens. “It is our hope that the councillors, being at the local level will be keen to apply the knowledge and experience gained from this training in order to advance the development of their communities.” he said.\nJPLG recognizes the importance of capacity building to equip local councillors with the tools to play a positive and decisive role in dispensing their duties in the council and ensure a sustainable future for all in Somalia within the country’s rapidly urbanizing environment.\nThe training covered the 12 globally endorsed roles of councillors dubbed “councillor’s hats”. The ‘power broker’ role which prescribes that institutional power should be used for public interest was what Qamar Dhiblawe, one of the women in Warsheikh council noted as needful towards improving their council.  The training also offered the councillors an opportunity to investigate their weakness and brainstorm on best ways of enhancing service delivery in their respective councils while learning from their best practices.\nThis was the first training of its kind delivered to local leaders in Hirshabelle State selected into office by the community. Speaking at the launch of the training, Hirshabelle state president Mohamed Abdi Waare said, “It is my hope that Warsheikh being the first district in Hirshabelle to select the representatives of their choice will be a model council for our local governance system.” He commended UN-Habitat and the donors for empowering the local council.\nGlobal goals recognize cities as the primary drivers of economic development due to their ability to facilitate agglomeration economies that induce sustained growth. In Somalia just like other countries, there is increasing emphasis on the need for local governments and policymakers to gain a deeper understanding of how they can improve urban service delivery.\nThe training adhered to COVID-19 protocols and incorporated local governments guide to COVID-19 to ensure safety precautions were observed to prevent spread of the virus.\nJPLG is supported and fully funded by; the European Union(EU), the UK’s Department for International Development (UK-DFID), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), Norway,  the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) , the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-trained-facilitators-deliver-the-local-leadership-management-training-to-somalia%E2%80%99s", "abstract": "Hirshabelle, Somalia 8 October 2020- Twenty-nine councillors from Warsheikh district successfully co..."},

We have seen hospitals overflowing, jobs disappearing, schools closed and movement restricted. But we can, and we will recover, and use our experiences to build back better and greener.\nSome of the key opportunities are highlighted in World Habitat Day’s theme this year - Housing for All: A Better Urban Future.\nHousing is now widely recognised as a frontline defence against COVID-19, with residents across the world being told to stay at home and wash their hands. But these simple measures are impossible for the 1.8 billion people living in inadequate housing conditions, informal settlements, overcrowded homes, homelessness, and unstable housing conditions.\nCities and towns have moved quickly to provide emergency housing solutions and shelter for the homeless, quarantine spaces, to postpone evictions and truck in water. We must not allow these achievements to be reversed once the pandemic is over. These temporary measures need to lead to long term policy changes.\nOtherwise, poverty and inequalities will be further exacerbated, and millions of people are at risk of losing their homes, once temporary bans on evictions are lifted, or when the lack of the stable income results in missed rent or mortgage payments.\nAt the same time, we must recognise that providing adequate housing is a shared responsibility, which depends on national and local governments, civil society, businesses, and local communities working together.\nUN-Habitat is launching a five weeks long campaign on ‘Housing for All’, to spread the message that housing is more than just a roof. Adequate housing is central to providing shelter against safety and health risks. It is an essential condition of living in dignity, and the basis for belonging and wellbeing, and a key for access to public spaces, job opportunities, hospitals, schools, and food.\nInclusive, affordable, and adequate housing is the central to transforming our cities and communities and making them resilient, and to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 11 and all the SDGs.\nOn World Habitat Day, we need to join forces to respond to the current crisis, share solutions and create cities of the future for everyone.

The pandemic is having a huge impact on all areas of life in metropolitan areas but also provides an opportunity to rethink the role of metropolitan governance in crises. World Metropolitan Day, which marks the anniversary of the Montréal Declaration on Metropolitan Areas (2015), provides an opportunity not only to focus on the importance of metropolitan governance to create more sustainable, liveable and healthy cities; but also the challenges and opportunities created by the pandemic.\nDuring the ongoing World Metropolitan Day 2020 campaign, metropolitan governments and a wide range of institutions worldwide (private companies, academic institutions, civil society organizations, multilateral entities, city networks and urban influencers) have been sharing initiatives aimed at accelerating a positive transformation in cities as a response to COVID-19 and at achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe pandemic requires coordination across all the administrations at different levels and the urban-rural continuum, and rethinking the current metropolitan governance systems.\nWhile being recognized as engines of economic growth, metropolitan areas are also the source of major inequalities and environmental challenges. The measures brought in to control COVID-19 have probably exacerbated this phenomenon. Moving forward metropolitan governance must prioritize the issue considering that around a third of the population, nearly 2.6 billion people currently live in metropolitan areas.\nThe event will bring together various local governments representing Buenos Aires, Barcelona Metropolitan Area, Barcelona City, Municipality of Cordoba, Madrid City, Mexico City and Montreal along with the Asian Mayors Forum, UCLG Africa, and the Marmara Municipalities Union, among others entities.\nThis event will take place in the framework of the Urban October, a month of celebrations that begins with World Habitat Day on 5 October focusing on Housing for All:A Better Urban Future and ends with World Cities Day on 31 October under the theme Valuing our communities and cities.\nFor more information on the World Metropolitan Day campaign and registration for the event, please visit: https://www.metropolis.org/campaigns/world-metropolitan-day   \n \nAbout Metropolis\nThe World Association of the Major Metropolises (Metropolis) is the global network of major cities and metropolitan areas.\nMetropolis brings together the governments of 141 urban agglomerations worldwide.

The purpose of the workshop was to receive feedback and facilitate discussions with Turkana County officials on the potential land-use proposals based on the existing situational analysis as well as proposals provided by the community, private sector, National and County Government Ministries and agencies from previous multi-level and multi-sector meetings. This plan would also support the County Government in having the plans needed for the conferment of the proposed Kakuma-Kalobeyei Municipality.\nDay one of the workshop began with an overview of urban development in Turkana County followed by UN-Habitat’s presentation of the Spatial Profiling of Kakuma and  Kalobeyei. The Spatial Profile is a multi-sectoral assessment of Kakuma and Kalobeyei, collating and creating spatial data to help inform decision making, specifically regarding the location of the Kakuma-Kalobeyei Municipality. Discussions of the Spatial Profiling was guided by a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis of Kakuma and Kalobeyei, with the aim of clarifying, verifying and identifying gaps in the research that has been conducted so far. This analysis was able to confirm some of the major findings of the profile while also adding new perspectives to topics such as the tourism potential of Kakuma-Kalobeyei, changing political dynamics, the green energy potential of Turkana County and environmental conservation.\nDay two of the workshop was focused around presentations of the Socio-economic Survey, the Business, Local Economic Development Survey and the Kalobeyei Corridor Development Plan by UN-Habitat. Each presentation was followed by a question and answer session to understand the perspectives of the local authorities. Topics that arose from these discussions included the institutional arrangements to support the local economy, environmental management of the invasive species Prosopis juliflora, value chains such as retail and commercial charcoal and timber production and climate change. It also included proposals for potential industrial investments like the meat production and processing plants as well as logistics and transport planning which is key in stimulating local businesses and promoting flow of goods, services, capital and people in north-western Kenya part of the LAPSSET corridor.\nDuring the workshop Chief Officer of Turkana County Government Ministry of Lands, Housing, Energy and Urban Areas Management, Joshua Lemuya,  highlighted that “the planning of the Kalobeyei Infrastructure corridor and the spatial profiling work will significantly contribute to the process of attaining the proposed municipality status for Kakuma and Kalobeyei”. \nThe Director in charge of Physical Planning from Turkana County Government Ministry of Lands, Housing, Energy and Urban Areas Management, Davies Munialo, added that “the next phase of the planning process of the Kalobeyei corridor plan will focus on completing the development of the final land use proposals and probably have the plan submitted to the County Government before the end of the year 2020”.\nThe workshop concluded with discussions of ways forward, including the arranging of follow-up bilaterals with Turkana County Departments for further detailing of data and agreement for another multi-sectoral workshop to be organised soon. Semi-virtual and multi-sectoral workshops such as these have become essential due to restrictions of personnel movement that are expected to continue for the foreseeable future.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-and-turkana-county-government-meeting-moots-development-in-kenya%E2%80%99s-turkana-county", "abstract": "Kakuma, Kenya 7 October 2020 - UN-Habitat has been collaborating with Turkana County Government in v..."},

UN-Habitat China together with its partners in Wuhan and with collaborating national agencies, published four detailed papers on the emerging experiences on responding to COVID-19 in Chinese cities and towns.\nCOVID-19 broke out at an epidemic scale in Wuhan, in January 2020 with initial lessons on responding being learned in this metropolitan city of 10 million people but also in the secondary and county towns of Hubei Province. A wide range of measures were implemented to roll back the epidemic and restart the social-economic recovery. When municipal departments re-opened, UN-Habitat reached out in order to learn about and share the know-how around the response.\nUN-Habitat has been closely working with Wuhan and  with the municipal planning institute, the Wuhan Land Use and Spatial Planning Center (WLSP) since 1916 developing a programme to promote and develop improved public spaces in Wuhan. An international Placemaking Week was organized in late 2018 and thematic explorations on child-friendly city strategies and healthy cities began in 2019.\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, UN-Habitat set up a local partnership with WLSP and Wuhan University and invited the national agencies, CITIC General Institute of Architectural Design and Research, the Institute of Public and Environment Affairs and the China Women’s Development Foundation to be part of the initiative to develop the COVID-19 Wuhan Guidance Papers.\nThe first two Papers deal with Community Management Approaches and with the provision of non-hospital spaces for care and isolation. The capacity to support communities by organizing them in a citywide grid, with clear protocols on controls and quarantine was already established in Wuhan in February 2020. Existing smartphone platforms were adapted to the lockdown needs. Meanwhile, the health response was quickly complemented with new and converted quarantine centres. The Papers are complemented by three case studies, including one on sewage treatment challenges to which the private sector responded.\nTwo more Papers are about smart technologies. A first one shed light on the quick introduction of QR Apps and Big Data for Tracking and Mapping of people, indicating whether they were cleared to move around or requiring self-isolation. The final paper shows how tracking and mapping were used to steer the Resumption of the Economy and Community Life. More case studies show how mobile phones became essential, both in the response but also for the recovery, for instance as a tool to distribute consumption coupons.\nIn the e-launch of today, Mr. Yan Chung, the Deputy Director General of the Wuhan Natural Resources and Planning Bureau, expressed his gratitude for the global collaboration with China and Wuhan in fighting against COVID-19 and appreciated the sharing of experience amongst the collaborating institutions. Senior staff from the involved agencies and institutes presented the Papers. Panel discussions were moderated by Ms. Milena Ivkovich of ISOCARP and Mr. Wang Yu of NTNU (Norway).\nIn one of the panel discussions, Professor Serge Salat of Paris Special School of Architecture observed that the Wuhan papers highlight the big data and deep learning potential when engaging planners and public health professionals, to build together a spatial epidemiology science as the study of spatial and temporal variation in disease risk or incidence in urban environments. He added that “this approach has proven being very efficient in China in terms of timely information release, real-time risk monitoring, online communication and collaboration, trend analysis and judgment, and remote medical assistance. It has saved thousands of lives while ensuring a quick recovery of economic functions.”\nIn her closing remarks, Ms. Christine Knudsen, UN-Habitat’s Director of Emergencies, noted that COVID-19 is still a global scourge causing ill health, death, crisises and poverty, especially for the most vulnerable communities. She appealed to partners in Wuhan and China to increase their collaboration with UN-Habitat and cities in need to develop data-driven solutions in support of green and inclusive recovery and resilience plans.\nThe COVID-19 Wuhan Guidance Papers are available online in English and Chinese. In 2020 and 2021, UN-Habitat and WLSP will continue their collaboration, with a strong emphasis on urban health.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-china-and-partners-in-wuhan-share-covid-19-response-experiences", "abstract": "Wuhan, China, 2 September 2020 - The COVID-19 Wuhan Guidance Papers were released globally today in ..."},

The webinar introduced the recently launched sourcebook, “Integrating Health in Urban and Territorial Planning” developed jointly by UN-Habitat and WHO.\nOver 100 participants attended the webinar from all over India. The participants included Municipal Commissioners, CEOs, Managing Directors of Smart Cities, State Pollution Control Board Officials, State and District Health officials, Data / Technology Officers, Project Management Consultants (Team leaders and ICT experts), Master System Integrators, researchers, data enthusiasts and officials from city and state urban departments.\n“What is a smart city if it does not address health, if you are not healthy, why are you making smart cities?” questioned Kunal Kumar, Joint Secretary and Mission Director, Smart Cities, MoHUA in his opening remarks.\nDr. Marcus Grant, lead author of the sourcebook underscored the need to improve health equity at the community level while recommending the contextualization of an asset-based and people-centric approach to this integrated form of planning.\nDr. Nathalie Roebbel, Coordinator, Air Pollution and Urban Health, WHO Geneva, explained that the sourcebook is a starting point towards the larger vision of implementing the New Urban Agenda. She shared an example of how the WHO had applied this concept to develop housing and health guidelines, taking into consideration the policies and standards that needed to be put in place to make the housing stock equitable and healthier to live in.\nHerman Pienaar, lead of the Urban Lab, Planning, Finance and Economy Section at UN-Habitat said COVID-19 had been a massive stress test on the urban environment and a strong reminder of the gaps in the functioning of existing urban systems. He stated that for better success in blending health in urban planning, investments needed to be prioritized towards areas such as public open spaces that are currently labeled as ‘soft issues’, but in reality, contribute positively to the cumulative physical and mental wellbeing of citizens, and in long term, resilience and equitability in cities.\nD. Thara, Joint Secretary of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), MoHUA, highlighted that apart from a few selected cities like Chandigarh and Gandhinagar,  growth patterns of cities in India have primarily been organic, where the population settles first and then is provided with the basic facilities by governing institutions in a ‘fire-fighting’ manner, catering to the areas which are in the most dire need of an intervention.\nShe added that MoHUA is taking steps to implement GIS-based master planning in 500 Indian cities. From these, the 90 cities that have already completed the process represent 60-70% of the total urbanized areas in India.\nJyoti Rawat, Joint Commissioner, National Urban Health Mission shared the actions taken by the Government of India to reduce the infection of COVID-19 in urban areas and increase the health services delivery to the people during the lockdown.\nA pre-webinar survey found that  70 per cent of the participants thought that health professionals can efficiently contribute to urban and territorial planning by providing data and technical assistance on health statistics and demographics. In addition 55 per cent of the participants  mentioned that the biggest challenges to integrating health in urban and territorial planning are a lack of institutional capacity to foster intersectoral collaboration and the absence of an ­­enabling policy environment to integrate public health targets in the planning sector.\nLearn more about integrating health in urban and territorial planning.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/india-hosts-webinar-on-integrating-health-in-urban-planning", "abstract": "New Delhi, 10 September 2020 - UN-Habitat and partners recently held a webinar to address how the pl..."},

The current COVID-19 crisis has only added to the problem by exposing people who handle waste to  an increased risk of contracting the disease. On this World Cleanup day, I urge everyone to reduce their waste generation and cities to support the  efforts of citizens to reduce waste and dispose of all waste in a safe and environmentally sound manner. UN-Habitat’s “Waste Wise Cities” now has a membership of 165 cities. I urge other cities to join this initiative and share their experiences and good practices in waste management with other cities “.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/this-year-world-cleanup-day-has-a-different-meaning-in-lebanon", "abstract": "Beirut, 19 September 2020.

The United Nations has made significant progress over the decades in improving peace and security, poverty reduction, clean water and improved sanitation, gender equality, and other critical areas of development.\nIn 2000, the world was introduced to the ground-breaking concept of the Millennium Development Goals. Fifteen years later, we adopted the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with clear targets to be achieved by 2030. The New Urban Agenda helps nations harness urbanization as a catalytic force to deliver the SDGs.\nIn the past 75 years, the world has come a long way in our commitment to ensure adequate shelter for all. The built environment and the rapid rate of urbanization are now changing the very nature of the planet. By 2050, 70 per cent of humanity will live in urban areas and this year 95 per cent of all COVID-19 cases have been found in our towns and cities. Our fate is inextricably bound up with the places we call home - be it an informal settlement, a village or a city.\nNo journey is smooth. At this point in our history, the achievement of the SDGs may seem far away. Yet, I believe we can reach these Goals by empowering individuals, communities, neighbourhoods and cities to take small steps together.\nWe need to be inspired by past generations, we need to harness the drive of our youth, capture the wisdom of our elders, and encourage innovation and creativity at all levels.\nIf humankind is to survive, we need a global revolution of empathy. The next 75 years will be crucial as future generations will depend on us to make the right decisions today.\nAbove all, we need action on the ground, advocacy in the virtual world and commitment to do whatever it takes to leave future generations a better world, where no one and no place is left behind.\nDownload the statement here.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/statement-by-the-executive-director-of-un-habitat-maimunah-mohd-sharif-on-the-75th-anniversary-of", "abstract": "On this occasion of the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, we must not forget the good work of ..."},

The intervention was part of efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\nAt the outset, vulnerable households in Jimcaale and Ayaha IV IDP settlements who lack  bulk water storage facilities were provided with 300 litre containers. Then, over a period of two weeks in July and August, the settlements were each supplied with 500,000 litres was supplied by water tankers.\nThe activity was part of a European Union funded COVID-19 mitigation intervention under the Hargeisa Urban Water Supply Upgrading Project (HUWSUP) and implemented jointly with Hargeisa Water Agency.\n“We are happy to partner with UN-Habitat in the provision of water to these vulnerable communities, which will ensure improved hygienic measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Somaliland, raise awareness about the pandemic among the urban poor, as well as ensure that they have water for their domestic use,” said Mohamed Daarod, Director of the Hargeisa Water Agency.\nUN-Habitat also provided stocks of soap and water to the existing hand washing stations, set up in different strategic locations within the settlements. Asha Ahmed, UN-Habitat National Project Officer and Head of the Hargeisa Office, encouraged the community to use the water to promote their overall hygiene and frequently use the hand washing stations to minimize the risk of contracting COVID-19.\nSpeaking on behalf of the beneficiary communities, the chairpersons of the settlements, Mr. Omar Adan Araale and Mr. Yusuf Ibrahim Qaalib said the community was grateful for the continued interventions by UN-Habitat. “Provision of water was such a fundamental intervention in the face of a pandemic. We are also happy that the supply of water was timely and aligned with the Eid-al-Adha celebrations at the end of July,” said Mr. Qaalib.\nIn May, UN-Habitat and its partners completed work on the 23-kilometre-long main pipeline between the Ged Deeble wellfield and the Hargeisa water reservoir to Hargeisa City under HUWSUP. The next and final phase of the project will increase the amount of water available for Hargeisa from nine to 14.5 million litres per day, with the potential capacity to expand production to 24 million litres per day.\nJimcaale is a resettlement scheme with permanent housing, built in 2015 for 145 IDP families who previously lived in an informal settlement around the main Hargeisa Reservoir site. The families were resettled into a durable housing scheme, as the Hargeisa water project involved major construction works in the reservoir area, including the installation and connection of the new main pipeline for the city.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-provides-water-to-the-displaced-in-somaliland-to-curb-the-spread-of-covid-19", "abstract": "Hargeisa, Somaliland, August 2020 UN-Habitat has supplied one million litres of clean water to inter..."},

The company is the biggest investor in the island, with a focus on responsible tourism. As part of their investment to transform Roça Sundy into a hotel and a resort, HBD –for which many community members work for– agreed with the community to improve their housing conditions but since this was a big intervention in the island, the Regional Government contacted UN-Habitat to provide technical assistance for this endeavor.\nUN-Habitat’s Sustainable Resettlement Project in Roça Sundy directly benefits some 511 inhabitants (6% of the total population) through a Public-Private-People’s Partnership. The project implementation started in 2016 with the objective “to implement the voluntary and sustainable resettlement of the community of Roça Sundy, for improving their living conditions with full respect for human rights and through a participatory approach”.\nIn Terra Prometida, the new settlement for Roça Sundy community with 133 houses, including infrastructure and basic social facilities, the construction site had mobilized around 150 workers among them contractors, subcontractors, suppliers and sources of labor before the pandemic.\nThis was the biggest construction site in the recent history of the Island and unconfirmed reports of imported cases in the Island obliged UN-Habitat to plan with the local team for its potential evacuation, since the local health system is extremely weak and all complex health issues are dealt in São Tomé or even abroad.\nOn the other hand, evacuation also posed the danger of damaging the agency’s reputation with the local government and local community, since testing was lacking and no claimed imported cases were symptomatic, making the locals to believe that the virus never arrived in the Island. Based on these challenges, UN-Habitat together with the local team decided to anticipate and plan for different scenarios. The project immediately downgraded the number of workers in the construction site, also because the logistics to the Island was affected by the lockdown, compromising the delivery of key materials.\nUN-Habitat’s core team based in Principe developed an evacuation plan in case of any staff getting infected. Additionally, the government considered the project as an essential service, since the project became one of the most important economic activities in the island after the lockdown affected its most important economic sector: tourism.\nMany COVID-19-related safety measures took place for the continuation of the project. Personal protective equipment (PPE) was provided to staff to minimize risks for local spreading. Besides that, division of workstations, creation of work shifts, limitation of number of people in the project transport, compulsory use of masks in the project site, the banning of lunch in the construction site, creation of a handwashing station and the establishment of a sanitation team responsible to promote the adequate hygiene in the construction site were other measures adopted by the project.\nThese were complemented with awareness raising in the workplace focusing on workers to keep the measures in place. The project is currently in the end tage and even though the construction schedule is delayed especially due to constraints in logistics and lack of availability of some materials, thanks to our local team and the commitment of the workers and community members, the project became an important example of safe workplace in the Island that promotes the health of its worker while minimizes the potential socioeconomic impact of the pandemic in Principe.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-executes-a-model-safe-project-in-sao-tome-in-the-middle-of-the-covid-19-pandemic", "abstract": "Roça Sundy, Sao Tome and Principe 18 August 2020—UN-Habitat’s technical knowhow recently came in ha..."},

Local governments need to be innovative and pioneering to generate revenues, streamline expenditures and maintain provision of basic urban services,” said Mohamed Ali, the Director of Regions and Districts Administration at the Ministry of Interior in Somaliland.\n“With the world rapidly embracing digital technologies, JPLG sought to introduce and establish a system that would ensure a digitalized and efficient tax administration system, which will in turn influence improved and decentralized service delivery, as Garowe keeps up with digital trends,”   said Abdirazik Mahmoud Ali, Municipal Finance Office with JPLG.\nAccording to the World Bank, over 72 per cent of the Somali population have access to mobile phones. Since the launch of the pilot tests in April this year, there has been a significant difference in revenue collections.  A comparison between the revenue collected in the first quarter of 2019 and 2020 show a steady increase in revenue and similar trends are anticipated in other revenue streams, mainly property tax, which is billed twice a year.\nThe Mayor of Garowe, Ahmed Said Muse, thanked UN-Habitat and JPLG saying that the mobile money payment system was an important factor for maximized revenue in Garowe Municipality.\n“We look forward to doubling our revenue base as we are currently updating the property database,” he said.\nGarowe, Puntland’s capital, introduced a one dollar service tax to its residents which was tied to utilities such as water and electricity. As a result, USD 558,000 has been raised jointly by Garowe local government and city residents and the funds used to reconstruct 1.8 kilometres of the main road serving Garowe town.

Other measures mentioned include partial or full lockdowns, bans on inter-city movement, night curfews and regular fumigation of public places.\nAlthough regular handwashing is a recognized method of controlling the spread of COVID-19, only 15 per cent of respondents said they always had access to hand washing or sanitization facilities in public spaces; 35 per cent had regular access to the services; 34 per cent had limited access; and 8 per cent of the respondents had no access at all.  The remaining 8 per cent said restrctions on movement meant they could not access public spaces.\nThe most significant challenge for urban households included working from home, reduced incomes due to pay-cuts and job losses and supporting children with their school work. At the neighbourhood and city levels, the most significant impacts include disruption in goods supply chains affecting prices.  According to the survey, three quarters of the respondents had witnessed a change in the price of food and non-food items in their cities. For 83 per cent the price had gone up with only 1 percent noting a decrease in prices.  \nIn terms of urban security and safety, the adopted COVID-19 response measures and their enforcement (such as reduced movements and curfews) led to mixed results with some cities seeing an increase in security with others recording a worsening security and safety situation. Some cities have seen the levels of safety fluctuate over time.\nOver half of respondents  (52 per cent) said there had been a change in public transport in their city or neighbourhood. The changes included a reduction in the number of passengers allowed,  partial or complete shutdown of public transport systems, price fluctuations and mandatory facemask wearing.\n“The data generated from this survey helps us to estimate the extent of COVID-19 spread in cities and urban areas and the impact of the pandemic on urban residents, and complements other information coming from countries and other organizations, which is key to designing urban-specific response strategies,” said Robert Ndugwa, Chief of UN-Habitat’s Data and Analytics Unit.\nThe full survey results can be accessed here.

The lecture shows how data and policy innovations can further security provision for all.\n \nDownload audio\n \nSYNOPSIS\nIssues which the lecture addresses\nViolence in cities significantly compromises development and can have detrimental consequences for peace-building and political settlements in both conflict and non-conflict settings. The majority of the world’s most fragile and conflict-affected countries are rapidly urbanising, while much of the global burden of violent crime can be directly or indirectly linked to cities. But cities also abound with social, cultural and technological innovation and can bring 'smart' solutions to complex problems. Efforts to provide security, build political settlements and create safe cities for all need to go beyond reviewing simple statistics of death, destruction and violent crime. They need to engage 'the city' as a complex system.\n \nShort analysis of the above issues \nUrban violence is shaped by and shapes the physical and social landscapes of urban communities. For example, fear of violence prompts the physical separation of high-violence neighbourhoods from surrounding areas, and can force women, men and children to adapt their daily life to avoid areas prone to violence on their way to work, around their homes, or when they play. Beyond the psychological impacts of such circumstances, adapting one’s way of living in this manner usually also has a direct financial cost resulting out of the need to build barriers, take longer routes to work, or forego livelihood opportunities due to safety concerns. Implementing effective violence mitigation strategies therefore requires stakeholders to acknowledge varying types of urban violence, understand how these interact with the mechanics of security provision, and thereby bring a data-driven, spatially relevant, and city-specific thinking to how security is provided, and for whom it is provided. \n \nPropositions for addressing the issue\nJaideep Gupte begins by presenting the nature and extent of urban violence, and summarises cutting edge evidence on data driven approaches to urban security provision in the global south. Approaches that seek to securitise the city are juxtaposed with inclusive visions of the city where no one is left behind.\nThree main conclusions are arrived at: (1) To see urban institutions and process as central to security provision. Useful starting points in this regard are to focus on the ‘grid’ or the spatial design, layout and planning of the city to determine the institutions that exclude and include people, with a particular focus on the gendered dimensions that shape everyday realities of those living with violence or in conflict settings. (2) To set clear guidelines for policy responses and policing intervention to recognise different types of violence, particularly in the face of the varied nature of the experiences of violence and ‘everyday insecurity’ for city dwellers. (3) Consider identifying urban futures that are possible, probable, and preferable. Future scenario-planning approaches are useful in helping to assess the nature of future challenges, the types of policy response these might necessitate, and the potential long-term impacts of these interventions. Integrating urban futures within the frameworks of peace-building and political settlements in a rigorous and systematic way is essential as the world continues to urbanise, particularly in the most fragile and conflict-affected contexts.\n \nBIOGRAPHY\nDr Jaideep Gupte is a Research Fellow at the Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex, where he co-leads the Cities Cluster at the Institute of Development studies, and co-convenes the MA in Poverty and Development.

The guidelines on the redesign were produced by UN-Habitat and funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA).\n “These new guidelines promote physical distancing, controlled access to the markets, crowd control in markets as well as the observance of personal hygiene.  This will ensure the provision of  essential food to communities, and that markets are safe spaces for making and sustaining livelihoods and reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and other diseases,” Haregewoin Bekele, an urban planner with UN-Habitat, said at the event.\nA local street in the city will be used as an extension of the market with markers to designate spots for the women’s market. In the main market there will be spaced queues, physical distancing markers between shoppers, safety barriers between vendors and shoppers and hygiene centres at the entrances.\nWhere the markets are extremely congested, some  traders will be relocated to other open spaces. In Fara Gebaya market in Hawassa city, where a pilot is being run, part of the market will be moved to another open space while the main market is retrofitted. The new relocation site is 8,000 square metres and is designed to accommodate 280 vendors.\nTiratu Beyene and Amare Alemu the Deputy Mayors of the two cities welcomed the initiative and pledged joint cooperation. “Open markets are a common means of livelihood in Ethiopia. We are therefore very grateful for this intervention that will ensure that our people are safe as they earn their daily bread,” said Mr Alemu.\nUN-Habitat has ensured that the new  market designs will be practical and sustainable beyond the pandemic.

These new rules are particularly  challenging in the central region, as most of the schools are still recovering from Cyclone Idai, which struck the country in March 2019. UN-Habitat is adapting the implementation of the Basic Emergency School Plan (BESP) to include prevention and preparedness to COVID-19.\nUN-Habitat, in partnership with UNICEF, has been implementing the BESP in schools across the country since 2015 reaching more than 40 schools to date. Thanks to the support of the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations - ECHO and the Education Cannot Wait Fund, capacity trainings and direct implementation of the BESP began on 5 August 2020 in the central region in the Districts of Dondo, Gondola and Chimoio.\nThe BESP’s main objective is to implement a plan that will prepare schools for potential disasters and emergencies. This is particularly essential in Mozambique as it is one of the countries most vulnerable countries to climate change in Africa suffering from increasingly intense climate shocks.\n \n“When Idai came, we didn’t have a tool like the BESP to prepare ourselves. Many of the things I learned today on disaster preparedness I didn’t knew at the time, every school should have access to this tool.” says Sergio Gove, Headmaster of Dondo’s Secondary School.\nThe BESP implementation is an inclusive and participative process and to ensure its sustainability and efficiency, all the school community- headmasters, teachers, parents, community, and students, including the youngest ones- must be involved. All these actors will be part of an Emergency Management Committee and together will define each one’s responsibility to prepare in case of an emergency as cyclone, flood, and now COVID-19.\nOne of the components of the BESP trainings is to ensure access to information to school community members and, with the support of the National Disasters Management Institute (INCG), train them on the different types of emergency alert. “When Cyclone IDAI came, a lot of people didn’t have proper information or didn’t believe that a cyclone of this magnitude was coming. I am sure that now if it happens again everyone, including the school, will properly prepare” says Valnice Antonio, primary school teacher of 5 de Julho School in Dondo. \nAs the virus continues to spread in Mozambique, UN-Habitat’s team has included the participation of a School Health Specialist frm the District Education Departments to integrate preventive and preparedness measures to COVID-19 in the trainings. “Some of the parents are a little scared to send back their kids to school, but I think if we are prepared, we will be able to protect ourselves and go back to study again.” says Isabel, a 16 year-old student from Dondo’s Secondary School and member of the Emergency Management Committee.\nUN-Habitat and UNICEF will continue the capacity trainings and BESP implementations throughout the cyclone affected regions of Sofala, Manica and Cabo Delgado and the entire country, to ensure resilient schools and communities for a safe and uninterrupted access to education.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-includes-covid-19-prevention-as-schools-prepare-to-reopen-in-cyclone-affected-region-of", "abstract": "Beira, Mozambique, 27 August 2020 - UN-Habitat in Mozambique has adapted its activities on disaster ..."},

It aims to increase the capacity of national and local governments to formulate policies that improve housing affordability and sustainability.\nThe topic has always been central to the work of the partner organisations but has gathered even more relevance since 2019, when Housing Europe, the European Federation of Public, Cooperative & Social Housing, published its biennial report on “The State of Housing in the EU”. The report presented new findings demonstrating how the scarcity of affordable housing in Europe is a serious and growing problem that pushes an ever-larger number of people into housing insecurity and homelessness.\n#Housing2030 was kickstarted in May 2020 with an online workshop on “Access and Availability of Land for Housing Construction” and will be further advanced through the online workshop “Housing for Tomorrow: Towards Sustainable Homes and Neighbourhoods in the Mediterranean Region” (co-organised with the Ministry of Social Accommodation of Malta on 17 September 2020. more information can be found here: https://www.housing2030.org/)\nThe core objective of the #Housing2030 initiative is to identify and facilitate exchange and dissemination of best practices in relation to land, environmental sustainability, finance and governance and regulation as they relate to promoting housing affordability. \nTo this end, the partnership has opened an invitation for submitting examples of best practice through a short online form by 15 September 2020.  These innovative practices that successfully address affordability challenges in the housing systems will be the backbone of a new toolkit for policymakers developed through the initiative.\nThis partnership builds on UN-Habitat’s work to promote housing affordability globally.

The initiative, set to kick off in September 2020, will finance 25 Water Operators’ Partnerships (WOPs) over four years with the goal of advancing the operational, financial, social and environmental performance of beneficiary utilities, and improving the lives of the communities they serve.\n\nThe newly-approved EU WOP Programme will be implemented by the Global Water Operators’ Partnerships Alliance (GWOPA), an extensive UN-Habitat-led network with more than ten years’ expertise in promoting, facilitating and tracking WOPs. Commenting on the signing of the agreement, the Executive Director of UN-Habitat, Maimunah Mohd Sharif, highlighted that, “the EU-WOP Programme comes at a critical time as the world is once again reminded of the importance of water and sanitation utilities, and the enormous potential for them to learn from one another.”\n\nUnder-performance in a water utility often means unsafe water, frequent cuts, and limited coverage for communities, with women, the poor and other vulnerable groups disproportionately impacted. While the current COVID pandemic has highlighted the extent to which extent resilient water and sanitation utilities can ensure the wellbeing of communitie even during a crisis, many utilities are facing mounting challenges. Among the different approaches adopted to support them, WOPs stand out because of their emphasis on strengthening local capacity through peer mentoring. By building the local capacity of utilities, WOPs favour more sustainable, affordable and higher quality services over the long-term, and support local achievement of global targets such as SDG6 and the universal human rights to water and sanitation.\n\nJointly designed by the EU and UN-Habitat, the EU WOP Programme will begin with the launch of an international call for proposals for North-South and South-South partnerships between utilities. An independent selection committee will evaluate the proposals and select those that best meet programme criteria. Successful utilities will then be funded to implement their WOP over a three-year period with ongoing guidance and support from GWOPA.\nFurther details on selection criteria, overall timeframe, and eligibility will be available shortly on www.unhabitat.org\n\nFor media enquiries, please contact:\nCraig Laird, Partnerships and Outreach Expert, UN-Habitat GWOPA\nE-mail: craig.laird@un.org\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/european-union-boosts-progress-towards-sdg6-through-a-9-million-euro-wop-programme-with-un-habitat", "abstract": "The EU Water Operators’ Partnerships Programme, funded by the EU and implemented by UN-Habitat GWOPA..."},

Most of the so-called landfill sites that exist in India are usually dumping grounds which were originally low-lying areas and waste was used to fill them, thus the name ‘land-fill’. These dumping grounds are sites that cause excessive ground water pollution, methane gas emissions, fire-hazards and pests—something that is completely opposite to a scientific landfill site.\n“Sound landfill management” is the need of the hour as it minimizes risks to public health and the environment, leads to clean and resilient cities, contributes to improving resource efficiency, transition to a circular economy, and promotes innovation, employment and sustainable economic growth. This was the crucial consensus by panelists and about 94 participants from local governments, state urban departments and other bilateral and UN agencies who attended the webinar on Landfill Remediation: Exploring Opportunities for adoption of Fukuoka Method in Indian Cities organised by UN-Habitat in coordination with its Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific (ROAP) on 29 July 2020.\n“Fukuoka Method is a low-cost sustainable intervention on landfill remediation that intends to remediate dumpsites/landfills by utilising low cost technologies and resource materials. We feel, that the Fukuoka Method shall be extremely useful for the Indian context where remediation is also about using local resources, emphasising on segregation, recover recyclables and provide jobs to informal sector,” said Mr. Srinivasa Popuri, Senior Human Settlement Officer, ROAP, UN-Habitat, in his opening remarks.\n“UN-Habitat ROAP is working closely on this issue with experts since late 90s. We had the chance to collaborate and work with Fukuoka Method founders and have done pilot interventions in Ethiopia, Kenya and Myanmar amongst other countries. We intend to transfer the knowledge of this method to Indian cities,” Mr. Popuri added.\nDr. Prashant Gargava, Member Secretary, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) highlighted the need for resource intensive landfill site remediation in India in his keynote address. “India has been traditionally following the minimization, recycle and reuse paradigm since ages, our per capita waste generation is much lower in comparison to other countries, however, we started late on waste management as compared to other countries, hence, the challenges still remain particularly in the area of processing where in only 1/3rd of the total waste generated (roughly 150,000 tonnes per day) gets processed, 1/3rd goes to scientific landfill sites and remaining 1/3rd is still being disposed openly in dumpsites. Additionally, there are over 3,000 legacy waste dumpsites that needs to be taken care of,” added Dr. Gargava.\nMs. Pooja Varma, Urban and Governance Expert, UN-Habitat  presented the ongoing interventions of UN-Habitat India office under the Sustainable Cities: Integrated Approach Pilot (SCIAP) Project in 5 cities – Bhopal, Mysuru, Jaipur, Guntur and Vijayawada.\nMs. Swati Singh Sambyal, Waste Management Specialist, UN-Habitat  shared about the existing status of landfills and dumpsites in India. “As per CPCB’s data on dumpsites, India still has 3,159 operational dumpsites. Uttar Pradesh tops the charts, with 609 dumpsites, followed by Madhya Pradesh, with 378, and Maharashtra, with 327 dumpsites. Landfill capping and biomining are two possible solutions for managing dumpsites currently being explored in the country. However, many municipalities lack the budgets to opt for remediation of their dumpsites due to high capital and operational costs,” added Ms. Sambyal.\nDr. Matsufuji Yasushi, Professor Emeritus, Fukuoka University, Japan, also one of the founders of Fukuoka Method introduced the semi-aerobic landfill concept to participants and explained the interventions adopted in Japan (the technology has been adopted by over 80 per cent of local governments) and over 15 countries worldwide.\nSemi-aerobic landfill structure (Fukuoka Method) refers to a mechanism whereby leachate is quickly removed from waste materials, allowing the inflow of air by installing perforated collection pipes and vertical perforated gas venting pipes at the bottom of the landfill. As the outlet of the perforated collection pipe is always open to air, by using internal fermentation heat, air flows naturally, without the need for an external energy source. By maintaining aerobic conditions in the waste bed interior, the Fukuoka Method accelerates the decomposition of waste materials, improves leachate water quality and inhibits the emission of methane gas. “Local governments in developing countries do not have sufficient funds and this technology provides a cost-effective SWM solution. Leachate treatment via adoption of this method is also very simplified through biological treatment followed by chemical processing. This method is also environmentally friendly (UNFCC approved in 2011) and reduces methane emissions,” Professor Matsufuji added.\n“The Fukuoka Method is very scientific, and the economics of the technology can be worked around depending on the capacity and resources available to local governments. One of the other advantages is that it can be introduced at any stage of landfilling – be it a new or existing landfill. It can even be used to convert a 50-year old completed site into a sanitary landfill,” said Ms. Sachiyo Hoshino, Special Advisor to the Director, Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, UN-Habitat.\n“We have also been successful in adapting the technology in all types of weather conditions – be it in the dry, arid desert climate of Iran or hot and humid climes Malaysia. It has also succeeded in Bangladesh and Pakistan, which have weather conditions similar to India,” Ms. Hoshino added.\nThe presentations were followed by a Q&A session, where municipalities and local authorities’ representatives asked questions on the feasibility of adoption of Fukuoka Method in India, its economic viability and the time frame this method takes to treat dump sites.  Majority of the city authorities found that the Fukuoka Method would be quite useful for adoption in Indian cities based on an online poll during the Webinar.\nMs. Sachiyo Hoshino, in her closing remarks, thanked the participants for an interactive session and explained the further steps that UN-Habitat shall adopt to take this pilot intervention forward in India which shall involve coordination with specific cities in India to understand the country specific context and challenges and work with city municipalities for handover of technology. \nTo take this intervention forward, UN-Habitat India shall discuss with the 5 SCIAP cities about steps to take the pilot intervention forward.\nFull recording of the Webinar can be accessed at UN-Habitat India official YouTube Channel at: https://youtu.be/aJQC_krOvss\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-concludes-a-webinar-on-landfill-remediation-towards-adoption-of-fukuoka-method-in-india", "abstract": "New Delhi, 29 July 2020 – Across the developing world, open dumping sites have been a major concern ..."},

The report was released in English and Chinese.\nEstablished in 2019, CFCC is chaired by Lu Weiding, the Chairman and CEO of Wanxiang Group in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. Wanxiang Group, established in 1969, has 40,000 employees manufacturing electric mobility solutions and clean energy systems and is developing smart solutions for urban development.\nThe Vice-Chair of CFCC, Pan Shengdong, co-leads the Chengdu based high-tech company Xinchao Media, which introduced smart displays for residential elevators in China which also monitor safety issues such as earthquake events. Other Chinese companies, such as JD Digits, Huawei, AIpark, BOE and KE.com supported the report.\nDuring the online launch, UN-Habitat’s Executive Director, Maimunah Mohd Sharif observed how e-governance is reshaping the relationship between governments, companies and citizens in many ways including the delivery of inclusive public services and with regard to digital rights. Noting that she had launched the CFCC initiative in Beijing in April 2019, the Executive Director welcomed the report and its contribution to the strategic results of UN-Habitat.\nThe launch video was moderated by journalist Zhang Yanfei. Chen Jun, representing Lu Weiding, focused on the importance of scientific and technological innovation in the development and transformation of cities. He explained that given the Wanxiang Group’s footprint in the industrial heartland of the Zhejiang Greater Bay Area, near Shanghai, it was developing comprehensive and integrated smart city technologies in the Innova City development. \nPan Shendong highlighted the speed at which, he said, well-conceived, well-developed e-solutions can be rolled out in China and transform daily living saying his company reaches 100 cities, 600,000 elevators and 200 million residents. When the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, it broadcasted safety messages in its elevators together with UN-Habitat.  \nThe CFCC report reviews China’s emergent smart urbanization policy frameworks as well as the efforts of private sector companies to establish urban service platforms. It observes several trends with regard to the collaboration between city governments and the private sector, with a number of governance challenges ahead. The report also looks at the variety of urban services addressed by existing smart platforms and recognizes 16 different types of services, from mobility to energy management, from waste management to health services, and more. The report recognizes that smart technology is at the heart of urban innovation.\nCFCC aims to continue working with Chinese high-tech enterprises, capturing valuable Chinese experiences and translating these into policy advice for UN-Habitat and beyond as well as acting as a communication platform.      \n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-launches-its-first-china-smart-urbanization-report", "abstract": "August 2020 - UN-Habitat in collaboration with Xinhua News Agency launched a new report on smart tec..."},

Season 6 consists of 10 lectures.\n \nIn this lecture Roberto Rocco from the Delft University of Technology discusses how the Tragedy of the Commons - how people often use resources to their advantage without considering the good of society as a whole - relates to social sustainability and spatial justice, and how this can contribute to real sustainability in urban development.\n \nDownload audio\n \nSYNOPSIS\nIssues which the lecture addresses\nThe social sustainability of urban development solutions is often overlooked in favour of economic and/or environmental sustainability. This lecture brings together two areas of study that are generally separate: sustainability and socio-spatial justice. It does so by using Hardin's Tragedy of the Commons to illustrate the issues at hand, especially issues of justice, redistribution, and most specially, democracy and participation in decision making. It does so by using literature by Elinor Ostrom, Susan Fainstein and Patsu Healey on the communicative turn in planning. \n \nShort analysis of the above issues \nThe tragedy of the commons unveils crucial environmental and social impacts of the rational pursuit of self-interest by economic actors, and exposes the tragedy of resource exhaustion if self-interest is pursued mindlessly and free of societal control. It also reveals the challenges surrounding the just redistribution of the fruits of human activity, and how this redistribution is decided. These challenges are discussed through the lenses of Ostrom’s theories on the governance of the commons and Fainstein’s propositions on the just city. These two authors are used here to illuminate how the injustices built into the tragedy of the commons can and are customarily solved through communicative rationality and public justification. Finally, Healey’s ideas on the communicative turn in spatial planning are brought in to bridge Ostrom’s and Fainstein’s ideas into spatial planning theory. It concludes by stating that despite the obvious challenges presented by powerful interests overriding the conditions for spatial justice in the city, there is still great potential in systems of public justification and reasoning to pursue just outcomes in the distribution of spatial benefits and burdens of urban development.\n \nPropositions for addressing the issue\n1. Introduction of the Tragedy of the Commons\n2. Introduction of a socially sensitive notion of sustainability\n3. Discussion on the issue of justice and redistribution of resources and the connection with space and urban development\n4. Introduction of the notion of spatial justice as bedrock for social sustainability\n5. Discussion on how resources are redistributed (distributive justice) and how this is decided upon (procedural justice) and how these notions can be used by policy makers when designing policy. \n \nBIOGRAPHY\nRoberto Rocco is a scholar committed to understanding the relationships between society and the production and governance of the built environment. This means that he investigates how actors and institutions from the public sector, the private sector and civic society interact in planning, designing, governing and inhabiting the built environment, both formally and informally. These basic but foundational ideas explain much of his actions as an educator and researcher at the Delft University of Technology. At TU Delft, he is responsible for course development and coordination in the areas of research methodology in areas of planning and design practice, regional planning and design, governance and sustainability. He leads the TU Delft Summer School Planning and Design with Water, a summer school for 100 students mostly from the Global South in which they explore how to make cities resilient to climate change through water sensitive urban planning and design. He has taken part in several MOOCs and coordinated the Spatial Justice module of the MOOC RETHINK THE CITY.\n \nADDITIONAL READING MATERIAL\nHardin, G. (1968). The Tragedy of the Commons.

The resulting document of May 2019 recognised the need for a United Nations system-wide approach to urban data management, that would align protocols for data sharing at the global level.\nIn focused sessions of the EGM, representatives from Madrid, New York, Los Angeles, Durban, Helsinki, Mannheim, Qassim, Bogota and Buenos Aires detailed the specific monitoring needs and challenges of cities from different contexts. United Nations Agencies including UN Women, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNESCO, UNGSII and UNODC along with all UN Regional Economic Commissions shared information on urban data collection methods and the importance of inclusion of relevant dimensions in the framework.\nLikewise, Citibanamex, CitiIQ, ThinkCity, and ITU explained existing methodologies of city data measurement frameworks to be integrated into the framework for greater cohesion and standardization.  In open discussions, participants explored the approaches to urban data management and aligning protocols for data sharing at the global level.\nIn the final discussions of the meeting, various organisations like the OECD, UNICEF and others announced their commitment and support for the ongoing process for the development of the Framework. There was a powerful pledge from Shanghai to fully support UN-Habitat and the SDG Cities Flagship Programme in carrying out joined-up research for the development of an Index and an Award which will recognize cities for their urban sustainable development practices, and to develop a Voluntary Local Review showcasing Shanghai’s advancement in the local implementation of the SDGs.\nThe meeting concluded with the agreement to arrange a  Joint Urban Monitoring Group to further develop and finalise the monitoring framework which will be submitted to the United Nations Statistical Commission for its consideration at the Commission’s 52nd session in March of 2021.\nThe development and adoption of a UN System-Wide Urban Monitoring Framework represents a significant step for the support to Local and Regional Governments and stakeholders in the elaboration of Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs), further strengthening the links between the national and local monitoring and reporting processes for the implementation of the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. Through an effort to provide coherence and continuity to the support to subnational monitoring processes, the results of this Expert Group Meeting (EGM) will feed into the wider work of UN-Habitat on VLRs and specifically into the discussion of an EGM dedicated to VLRs that UN-Habitat will host in December 2020 in collaboration with Madrid City Council.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-leads-the-collaborative-development-of-the-united-nations-system-wide-urban-monitoring", "abstract": "Madrid, 12 August 2020- Over 100 urban experts from the United Nations system, academia, city leader..."},

UN-Habitat has moved quickly to work with the international response to the explosions at the Port of Beirut in Lebanon’s capital a week ago that left more than 160 people dead, thousands more injured and around 300,000 people homeless.\nThe massive destruction to homes and buildings impacted some 60,000 households and affected thousands of buildings. UN-Habitat has deployed staff to Beirut Municipality and is leading the digitization of damage assessment data for buildings through a mobile application, GIS and mapping support. The initial assessments will bring together information on the location and extent of damage and local socio-economic conditions to enable a targeted response addressing the most urgent needs. The mapping is helping UN-Habitat to identify where water supplies and tanks are most critically needed. In Bourj Hammoud, UN-Habitat has deployed field teams to assist the assessment of buildings.\nUN-Habitat Lebanon is closely coordinating with other United Nations agencies, the humanitarian community, local and government authorities. Through the Emergency Operations Cell, led by the UN Humanitarian Coordinator with the Government of Lebanon, UN-Habitat is co-leading the Shelter Sector with UNHCR and is sending a team to take part in the household assessments led by the Lebanese Red Cross.\nUN-Habitat is also  co-leading a consortium to remove and manage the huge amount of debris and rubble left by the explosion. The initiative “From the Rubble” involves sorting and storing non-recyclable glass and debris and turning them into material for landfill in mountains severely eroded by quarrying.  \nUN-Habitat will contribute to the reconstruction and rehabilitation of impacted neighbourhoods together with the wider relief community.

He remained in the park with his wife and six five children during the city’s occupation by the militant ISIL group and took in his brother’s daughter when the rest of her family died in the conflict.\n“I have been living for over two decades with my family in a few rooms that I built myself with concrete blocks. We did not have running water or a proper toilet. I had very little money,” Mr. Suliman said. “It was a space that only animals could live in. Every year, in spring, we were suffering from floods that destroyed most of our belongings. I always dreamt of living in a proper house.”\nAl-Yarmouk Park had not been maintained for nearly a decade and was full of rubbish, benches had been stolen and trees cut down for fuel. UN-Habitat started rehabilitating the park in late 2019 creating over 200 jobs for skilled and unskilled workers from the surrounding area, including female workers. The project, funded by the EU, includes new sports facilities, playgrounds, a community hall, a new irrigation and lighting system, and an intense horticulture training programme, targeting unemployed female residents, which will include planting of hundreds of trees and bushes.\nMr Suliman thought he would be evicted but instead UN-Habitat reached an agreement with the Municipality to assign him as one of the park guards and provide him with a prefabricated house on higher and safer ground.\n“Many residents of the area are now passing by and congratulating me for my new house and feeling happy for me,” he beamed, sitting with his children in the doorway of his new home.\n “I will be taking care of the park as my home and family” said Mr. Suliman who is already taking care of the plants and has been occasionally hired as an unskilled worker by the contractors working on site. “This project has not yet been completed but it has already changed my life. I feel I can now provide a better future for my family.”\nUN-Habitat has adopted strict preventive measures for all construction site workers and supervisors including physical distancing, mandatory wearing of face masks and gloves, measuring body temperatures and frequent hand washing. Contractors were instructed to hire skilled and unskilled workers among unemployed residents of the target areas allowing the job to be done more quickly and supporting local livelihoods.\nProviding jobs and income at the height of the economic crisis triggered by the pandemic is key to help conflicted-affected urban communities in their recovery and is considered a key priority  during the four-year-long EU-funded programme Supporting Recovery and Stability in Iraq through Local Development implemented by UNDP in partnership with UN-Habitat.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/park-squatter-in-mosul-iraq-offered-new-opportunity-thanks-to-un-habitat-rehabilitation-project", "abstract": "Mosul, Iraq, August 2020 – After squatting in Al-Yarmouk Park in Mosul, northern Iraq, for 22 years,..."},

The expansion of this type of housing responds to structural causes, such as increasing inequality and a polarisation process, and also to individual preferences. In addition, GC have positive and negative impacts that can be analysed according to several dimensions: spatial, economic, political and social.\n \nShort analysis of the above issues \nThe analysis of GC development is organised in three main areas: First, a discussion of the characteristics of GC. Second, an analysis of why GC have developed over the last 30 years. The causes include structural causes and subjective preferences. Third, an exploration of spatial, economic, social and political consequences of the expansion of GC, showing both the negative and positive effects of this type of residential development. Finally, the conclusion of the lecture addresses the implications of GC development for planning.\n \nPropositions for addressing the issue\nThe discussion of the characteristics of GC is essential as there are several definitions and this has an impact on how we understand the phenomenon, and also on how planning frameworks can addressed their growth. There are some elements that create controversy in the definition of GC. * GC constitute the main type of housing development from the formal system (usually encouraged by the private sector, with the endorsement of the government). * There are important positive and negative impacts of the development of GC. In particular, it is important to consider them in relation to the type of cities we want to live in and in particular, on the relationship with SDG11 and the New Urban Agenda * Urban planning has a crucial role and should use some instruments to minimise the negative impacts of GC and maximise their positive impacts. All these points will be illustrated with examples.\n \nBIOGRAPHY\nSonia Roitman is a Senior Lecturer in Development Planning in The University of Queensland, Australia.

Research evidence globally tells us that this ‘place value’ is shaped by how places are designed and that well designed places are fundamentally good for us. Achieving this in the face of short-term development, market, political and social pressures is not always easy, but research suggests that the governance of urban design is critical. This does not necessarily imply the use of more and tougher formal regulatory mechanisms, but instead the use of informal tools using the soft powers of the state.\n \nShort analysis of the above issues \nUN Habitat’s own research shows us that well-designed cities are socially richer, environmentally kinder and economically more productive. Despite the evidence, we continue to shape cities to meet short term goals, rather than the long-term sustainable needs of people and planet. The immediate reaction may be that we need to regulate and control more, but, as well as being expensive to enact, the top-down imposition of crude controls has actually been behind many of the patterns of development that undermine, rather than deliver, place value. What is needed are place specific interventions that shape a positive environment for good design in a proactive and intelligent manner – encouraging, engaging and enabling, rather than imposing crude controls from above.\n \nPropositions for addressing the issue\nThe lecture advances four propositions and ground each in examples of practice. First, place value is fundamental to the well-being of citizens. Second, place value is not delivered by chance, but requires careful and intelligent shaping of the built environment. Third, this shaping happens all the time – it is nothing new – but more often than not we seem to get it wrong, shaping unsustainable rather than sustainable design outcomes. Fourth, we need to try something new, moving toward the informal tools and soft powers that can help to shape market and state forces in a proactive and positive manner. These informal tools of urban design governance have the potential to be used globally.\n \nBIOGRAPHY\nMatthew Carmona is Professor of Planning and Urban Design at The Bartlett, UCL.

Speaking during a webinar on An Opportunity to Build Back Better: the potentially transformative impact of Covid-19 on road safety in low- and middle-income countries, the Minister Dagmawit Moges said the 56 per cent reduction was due to lower traffic volumes and increased law enforcement.\nThe webinar, organized by the United Nations Road Safety Fund also featured the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Road Safety, Jean Todt, the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Olga Algayerova, and the Deputy Director-General for Mobility and Transport,  European Commission, Mathew Baldwin.\nThe UN-Habitat Executive Director, Maimunah Mohd Sharif, emphasized the need to create an opportunity out of the current crisis as physical distancing has encouraged cities to focus on providing better infrastructure for walking and cycling. “Only by rethinking cities and mobility can we have a transformative impact,” she said.\nMost fatalities and injuries from traffic accidents are in low-and middle-income countries where increasing motorization and rapid road infrastructure development have outpaced the provision of safe intersections, modern public transport systems, footpaths and bicycle lanes.  \nCurrently traffic volumes are lower in most countries due to lockdowns and curfews, but speakers also mentioned there is an increase in excessive speeding on the quiet roads.\nSupported by the United Nations Road Safety Trust Fund, UN-Habitat is currently implementing a project on “Scaling up Safe Street Designs in Ethiopia”. The project supported the development of the recently launched Non- Motorized Transport Strategy which seeks to ensure the greater uptake of walking and cycling through better design of bike lanes and footpaths.\nStefanie Holzwarth, Associate Expert in the Urban Mobility team of the Urban Basic Services Section of UN-Habitat presented the project during the webinar.\n“Among the outcomes of the project are policy support, harmonization of existing street design manuals, street design review assistance on footpath and cycle tracks, but also support to multi-stakeholder engagements such as open street days, cycle rides,” she said and described how the project is using virtual, interactive platforms for stakeholder engagement due to the pandemic.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-calls-for-cities-to-use-pandemic-as-an-opportunity-to-improve-cycling-and-walking", "abstract": "24 July 2020 – The COVID-19 crisis has led to the number of deaths in road accidents in Ethiopia bei..."},

The Policy Brief COVID-19 in an Urban World, outlines ideas for governments to address the pandemic, particularly in the areas of inequalities, building local capacities and ensuring a green, inclusive recovery.\nThe Brief praises the front-line role of local government and the mobilization of local government networks to share the wide range of solutions emerging from cities. It outlines immediate and long-term action needed in three areas: tackling inequalities and development gaps, strengthening the capacities of local actors, particularly local governments and working towards a green, inclusive and resilient recovery.\nThe Policy Brief describes how the pandemic has exposed deep inequalities in how people live in cities and the services available to them and finds that the vulnerable have suffered the most. It says that overcrowding, poor infrastructure and housing are key contributing factors to this.\nCOVID-19 shutdown measures have had far reaching economic impacts according to the Policy Brief which calls for national COVID-19 stimulus packages to be designed to boost the capacity of local actors, including the budgetary capacity of local governments, to quickly respond to and recover from this crisis.\nIn a recorded video statement to launch the Policy Brief the UN Secretary-General António Guterres called urban areas the “ground zero of the COVID-19 pandemic” but added that this was an opportunity to \"reset how we live, interact and rebuild our cities\".\nDuring a virtual Press Briefing to launch the Policy Brief, the UN-Habitat Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif told reporters: “The Secretary-General’s Policy Brief is a powerful instrument to put us on the right path to deal with the crisis and also to seize the opportunity to do things differently in the recovery, so that we can create greener, healthier and more resilient cities. The transformative potential of urbanization towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals cannot be lost. This moment cannot be missed.”\nThere are a number of key actions to tackle inequalities suggested in the Brief including providing access to safe shelter and moratoriums on evictions along with longer term policy shifts and investments in adequate housing, slum upgrading and public housing.\nUNDP Administrator Achim Steiner told the press conference: “Our programmes continue to address the complex root causes as well as the manifestations of development deficits that destabilize countries and cities. In alignment with the UN’s socioeconomic response framework, UNDP has quickly made available significant resources, technical as well as financial. We have repurposed some projects to support urgent needs where they are deployed and have just launched a USD 100 million financing support mechanism to build on progress from funds we made available to countries when the pandemic hit.”\nA resilient, inclusive, gender-equal and green economic recovery is crucial for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals according to the Brief which sees COVID-19 as an opportunity to rethink our cities to address the climate crisis and adapt to the reality of the current and future pandemics.\nThe Policy Brief is part of a series being issued by the UN-Secretary General to provide ideas to governments on how to address the crisis as part of the UN Comprehensive Response to COVID-19 to save lives, protect societies and recover better.

Developing better resilience against future threats, including pandemics, has become a core concern for many city administrations.\nDigital technologies have proven to be a key part of solutions during this crisis, allowing local and regional governments to continue to offer essential public services, ensuring an avenue for many businesses to continue operations and keeping people in touch while following COVID-19 related public health measures. Digital technologies will also be pivotal to the future sustainability of towns and cities everywhere, particularly as we enter the Decade of Action to address the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\nThe potential of digital technology to be a transformative power for cities is clear and so should the commitment to bridge the digital divide. Local and regional governments will and must play a crucial role in shaping this transformation and they will need support to ensure equitable transparent access that will strengthen governance processes.  \nLocal and regional governments are proving their commitment to addressing and reducing the barriers to technology and the digital divide through participatory policies and programs that include groups and areas which remain marginalized and excluded from the benefits of digitalization.\nHowever, the rapid adoption of digital technologies in response to crises such as COVID-19, can compel authorities to take decisions involving digital technologies without giving due consideration to the complex and long-term impacts on human rights and their adherence to the principles of transparency and accountability.\nTo address these challenges and to harness the opportunities offered by digital technologies to leave no one and no place behind, city leaders, administrations and key stakeholders, will need support to develop actionable frameworks that allow them to lead discussions in their cities around digital technologies for access to and the delivery of key services.\nThe Coalition of Cities for Digital Rights, an initiative launched initially by the cities of Amsterdam, Barcelona and New York City with a membership of over 50 cities worldwide, recently published a set of recommendations to guide city leaders, urban managers and other stakeholders as they use technology in response to  crises such as COVID 19. These recommendations provide a framework that places human rights at the centre, providing guidance on how to involve the beneficiaries of technology and how digitalization can be managed and monitored to promote inclusive access and positive impacts for all in urban communities.\nThese recommendations focus on areas such as consent and trust, openness and transparency, fairness and inclusion and social innovation; and are particularly valuable at this time given the impact of COVID-19 on diverse populations within cities. We also see growing social and racial inequalities, partly based on unequal access to technology. Within this context, enhancing the capacity and role of local and regional governments to make the most of digital technologies, through knowledge and financing mechanisms that support inclusive and non-discriminatory digital development and public procurement processes, will ensure that communities are at the forefront of digital innovation and that their rights are protected.\nThat’s why we encourage city leaders and managers to use the recommendations as a starting point for conversations within their organizations and amongst their constituents to promote the understanding of and improve access to technology. We also encourage cities to join the Coalition and be part of the ongoing momentum to strengthen digital rights.\nThe Coalition will put these recommendations into practice and document activities and good practices so that cities and organizations can learn how to apply them and understand their impact on urban communities. Furthermore, the Coalition will seek to partner with academia and other key stakeholders on these recommendations. Case studies will be presented at the Coalition’s annual convening conference/session in September.\nIt is time to take action and build inclusive digital systems and provide opportunities in our cities that reduce the digital divide and promote cities for all.\nMichele Bachelet Jeria is the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\nMaimunah Mohd Sharif is the Executive Director of UN-Habitat                                          \nEmilia Saiz is the Secretary General of United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG)\nAnna Lisa Boni is the Secretary General of Eurocities\nCities who would like to learn more about the Coalition, please review the checklist of digital rights actions and fill out this form to formally indicate your interest in joining. \n \n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/digital-rights-in-the-covid-19-era", "abstract": "Around the world, cities have stepped up in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing changes to ou..."},

We kept holding the walls until dawn waiting for the wind to stop,” said Bile who lived in the home with his wife, toddler daughter and five brothers and sisters..\nThe cyclone which struck the central region of Mozambique in March 2019 left devastation in its wake with over 13,599 houses being destroyed and more than 4,800 badly damaged  \nUN-Habitat scaled-up its activities to support the Government in reconstruction activities and in January 2020, the project “Promoting Resilient Recovery of Housing and Infrastructures in Communities affected by Cyclones in Mozambique” was launched. The project, implemented with the support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), aims to support the establishment of models and technical standards for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of resilient housing and infrastructures in urban affected areas.\nTechnical workshops were organized to reach a consensus on resilient housing models and standards   with the Post-Cyclone Reconstruction Cabinet (GREPOC), the National Institution for Calamity Management (INGC), Eduardo Mondlane University and the Municipality of Dondo (Sofala Province in the central region). To test these standards, two models were piloted (one rehabilitation and one retrofitting), including Bile’s roof in Nhamaiábwe, one of the most affected neighbourhoods where 3,315 houses were destroyed. One resilient house was built in Dondo.\n Vulnerable beneficiaries were selected with the Municipality and the community using criteria as socio-economic conditions, location, conditions for issuance of occupation land right and structural conditions of the houses for the rehabilitation works.\nThe three resilient models were handed over to the beneficiaries by the President of the Municipality of Dondo , in an official ceremony on 16 June 16 with UN-Habitat’s Head of Programme in Mozambique Wild Do Rosario, Zefanias Chitsungo from GREPOC, Ghulam Sherani from UNDP, local artisans, and beneficiaries and their families.\nCarpenters and masons from Dondo who worked on this project were trained by UN-Habitat’s staff and received a certificate during the ceremony.\nWhile the pilot intervention was only implemented in Dondo, it aims to support the Government of Mozambique with its response to housing recovery in communities affected by Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, in the central and northern regions of the country.\n“I had never seen this type of roof.

The resulting Settlement Profiling Tool uses geo-spatial analysis, simple illustration and mapping out of information in government development policies, strategies and other humanitarian and development actor plans to help ensure wider access and understanding.\nThe user-friendly Tool guides local authorities and humanitarian-development professionals such as UN Agencies, donors and NGOs  through an iterative process of investigation with the aim of developing a common baseline of information. The project donor was UNHCR.\nAccording to Yuka Terada who leads the Planning for Humanitarian and Development Practice in UN-Habitat, “this tool can be utilized to enhance the efficiency of humanitarian activities and bridge the gap towards development oriented progress”.\nThe Tool aims to enable stakeholders to prioritize investment opportunities and make informed decisions for refugee and hosts communities and provide entry points for more sustainable development trajectories.\nThe Settlement Profiles produced as a result of this Tool use an urban planning lens to provide a comprehensive overview of the relevant physical, social-economic and policy dynamics affecting a particular settlement, provide a selection of development scenarios and recommendations of potential ways forward.\nThis Tool has been piloted in Nakivale, Uganda and Kebribeyah, Ethiopia. Kebribeyah in particular has hosted refugees for over 28 years, is the oldest refugee settlement in the Somali Regional State and has a history of trade links between the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. It presents unique opportunities to strengthen cohesion between refugees and host community and address ongoing challenges facing the settlement and region which include protracted instability of Somalia, rapid urbanization of the district and the poor living conditions and infrastructure in the refugee settlement.\nThe Mayor of Kebribeyah and his team are using the Settlement Profile to support further planning initiatives in the city, including the potential replanning of the refugee settlement area to allow for improved and more equitable water service provision, road access and housing upgrading.

Participants called for the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda to be considered as roadmaps to encourage national governments and sub-national actors to address the current crisis and build long-lasting resilience together. They also discussed how effective crisis response requires multilevel approaches and require better engagement of local and regional governments (LRGs) in national climate action efforts.\nUN-Habitat’s Executive Director, Maimunah Mohd Sharif called for global support to: “get Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) delivered on time and with the sort of ambition that sets us on a course to limit global warming to 1.5-2.0 degrees, and helps build resilience to climate disasters. Countries need our contributions and ideas.”\nIn order to support such multilevel efforts, UN-Habitat published a new guide, Enhancing Nationally Determined Contributions through urban climate action. The report provides practical opportunities for incorporating urban climate action and human settlement issues into the current NDC revision and enhancement process, drawing on existing knowledge and networks. It contains a simple step-by-step approach designed for quick and effective application by NDC coordinators.

This project will contribute to urban resilience in the region, building on existing efforts and harnessing and amplifying the talents, ideas and enthusiasm that is already so apparent.“\nThe four countries of the project, with the facilitation of UN-Habitat, joined forces in 2013 to establish DiMSUR, the sub-regional Technical Centre for Disaster Risk Management, Sustainability and Urban Resilience. The Centre fosters the development and dissemination of knowledge and solutions for disaster risk management, climate change adaptation and urban resilience and will coordinate the regional-level activities of the project.\nMikko Ollikainen, Manager of the Adaptation Fund Secretariat said: “Our support to vulnerable countries ranges across nine sectors including urban development and Disaster Risk Reduction which are areas where Southern African countries face significant challenges induced by rapid urbanization and recurrent natural hazards.\n“By supporting national governments to create enabling conditions for scaling up and replicating the same climate resilience approach in other urban settlements, we have confidence in this project to create conditions for impacts beyond its 4 years term.”\nThe project is funded by the Adaptation Fund and implemented by UN-Habitat alongside the four Governments, OXFAM, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and DiMSUR. Country and city level working groups were formed to facilitate the planning and implementation process.\nPriority actions for the project will cut across regional, national and city levels and include preparation and implementation of sub-projects, development of tools and guideline for training delivery and inter-country sharing of experiences and lessons learnt.\nThe event included a dialogue session between representatives from the national government and city administrations to share key challenges and opportunities in their countries.\n“In Madagascar, climate change is a reality the consequences of which are being felt more and more.

Since it began in 2015, the Initiative has attracted over 250 active Champions and has 160 alumni covering a wide range of thematic areas including disarmament, trade, justice and standards. The IGC network also has hubs in Geneva, The Hague, New York, Vienna and Paris.\nThe Nairobi launch featured a discussion on Gendered impacts of COVID-19 and the actions taken by agencies in Kenya to mainstream gender in COVID-19 responses which had over 50 attendees. The new Nairobi Champions were invited to share strategies that their organizations have used to ensure that the responses to COVID-19 and any recovery initiatives are gender-responsive.\nThe UN-Habitat Executive Director urged the new and prospective champions to continue to expand the network and to engage more leaders who pledge to improve gender imbalances in decision-making, and in policies and practices.\n “When women and men stand side-by-side it really is a win-win for sustainable development,” said Ms Sharif who is also part of the Deputy Secretary-General’s Women Rise for All Initiative and featured in a video which was just released.\nUNEP’s Executive Director stated that entrenched inequality has been amplified during this crisis and has put women at even greater risk including indigenous people and other marginalized groups.\nThrough the IGC network, the Champions while continuing to address the mandates of their organisations, can work together to challenge harmful gendered impacts of COVID-19 during and after the pandemic.\nIn her speech, Mrs. Bangura said: “At the United Nations office at Nairobi, our focus has been duty of care to staff.

Prof. Angel proposes and addresses six factors that constitute urban density.\n \nDownload audio\n \nSYNOPSIS\nIssues which the lecture addresses\nSerious concerns with global warming have been translated into urgent calls for increasing urban densities, as higher densities have been found to be associated with lower carbon emissions from both vehicles and buildings. Still, attempts at effective densification have generally failed and urban densities, the world over, continue to decline. Calls for densification without making room for it has resulted in serious housing supply bottlenecks in many cities and have rendered their housing unaffordable. \n \nShort analysis of the above issues\nShlomo believes that for affordable densification to be successful, we must better understand the anatomy of density or the factors that constitute urban density. They propose a novel way to decompose the average density of cities into three and then into six factors that when multiplied together reconstitute urban density. They present the methodology and the ensuing preliminary estimates of our measurement of these factors in ten pilot cities in ten world regions. Such decomposition into factors allows us, for the first time, to begin to understand how different cities acquire their density: Hong Kong, for example, gets its density from building height; Kinshasa from crowding; and Dhaka and Bogotá from residential coverage. The anatomy of density offers a new outline for a comprehensive making-room strategy for city densification, addressing each and every one of the six factors that constitute urban density. \n \nPropositions for addressing the issue\nSolly Angel introduces 5 principles as the conclusion towards a comprehensive strategy for making room for city densification. These are 1. Increase the Occupancy Rate, 2. Increase Floor Plan Efficiency, 3. Increase Building Height, 4. Increase Plot Coverage, 5. Increase Residential Share. For the Compact City Paradigm to remain relevant in the coming years, it must embrace making room. Otherwise, it will continue to disappoint, while precious time is squandered.\n \nBIOGRAPHY\nShlomo (Solly) Angel is a Professor of City Planning at the Marron Institute. He leads the NYU Urban Expansion based at the Marron Institute and the NYU Stern Urbanization Project. Angel is an expert on urban development policy, having advised the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). He currently focuses on documenting and planning for urban expansion in the developing world. \nIn 1973, he started a program in Human Settlements Planning and Development at the Asian Institute of Technology in Bangkok. He taught at the Institute from 1973 to 1983, while researching housing and urban development in the cities of East, South, and Southeast Asia. From the mid-80s to mid-90s, he worked as a housing and urban development consultant to UN-Habitat, the Asian Development Bank, and the Government of Thailand.

It brought together experts from UN-Habitat, World Bank, World Health Organization (WHO), the European Commission, European Environment Agency (EEA), tech firms and citizen science groups.\nThe workshop aimed to improve methodologies and data coverage for Europe, and to provide inputs for the upcoming revision of the SDG indicators at the UN Statistical Commission.\n“The European Commission is proud to co-host this workshop with UN-Habitat”, said Lewis Dijkstra from the Commission.  “On measuring air quality, we are convinced that there is a need to get closer to the reality of people, in particular in times of the COVID-19 crisis. We also need to get closer in scale to better monitor air quality, which has improved in recent months but is deteriorating again now as economic activity and mobility increase.”\nExperts from WHO, EEA and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission presented recent developments and latest research on the air quality indicator. “Interpolating air quality measurements with population density is an important step to assess the impact of air pollution on city residents,” said Evrim Öztürk from EEA.\nRepresentatives from citizen science initiatives from Brussels and the crowdsourcing platform sensor.community explained how they could help.\n“Brussels has 1.2 million inhabitants, an area of 160km2 but only 11 official monitoring stations,” explained Pierre Dornier from the citizen movement Les chercheurs d’air.\n“Crowdsourcing for measuring air quality is a great way to engage citizens and to raise awareness on air quality”, added Lukas Mocek from sensor.community.\nMeasuring access to public space, and how to improve public space so that all population groups have access were discussed on the second day when experts from UN-Habitat and the European Commission presented the state of the art of the public space indicator for the SDG monitoring.\nWhile there is a validated approach to measure access to green public spaces using satellite imagery, participants discussed the challenges in defining other public spaces.  “Assessing the quantity of public spaces is important when looking at inequalities. As cities grow, they tend to forget providing public spaces,” said Joy Mutai from UN-Habitat.\nThe World Bank explained their research on how to identify public space through remote sensing. “We discovered that even dense megacities have a huge potential for public spaces,” said Jon Kher Kaw from the World Bank.\n“The needs of women and children are not sufficiently considered when designing public space.” said Maria Vassilakou, the former vice mayor of Vienna. “We need to observe the actual use of a space, interview users and experts before redesigning a place or an entire area.

I was lucky to find out about this construction work and I am thankful I had a job for a month, and I hope there will be more opportunities like this in the future.”\nIn the rural town of Yathrib, Salah Al Din Governorate, 45 kilometres north of Baghdad, returnees are rebuilding their lives with the assistance of UN-Habitat following several years of conflict.\nSince UN-Habitat’s contractors are requested to hire skilled and unskilled labourers locally, the construction works enabled 56 people from the neighbourhood, most of whom are recent returnees, to find employment during the recent lockdown.\nThe majority of people in Yathrib, many of whom are former IDPs and recent returnees, work in seasonal or daily jobs to make up for their low return on farming which has suffered due to insecurity, conflict and under-investments in infrastructure.\nThe number of COVID-19 reported cases in the district has been among the lowest in Iraq since the beginning of the pandemic, which allowed UN-Habitat to continue with the EU-funded construction works and rehabilitation of houses begun before the lockdown. UN-Habitat adopted strict preventive measures for all construction site workers and supervisors – including physical distancing, mandatory wearing of personal protection such as face masks, measuring body temperature of all who enter the site and frequent hand washing.\nAs the construction material was delivered at the start of the project and labourers and supervising engineers live locally, UN-Habitat managed to complete the rehabilitation of seven houses, the first batch of the planned rehabilitation of 120 houses, in just a few weeks.  \n“Prioritising the delivery of materials to the site was a key for successful completion of the activities. We are grateful that the local authorities were extremely supportive and approved the continuation of our ongoing works,” said UN-Habitat Senior Programme Officer, Oday Lafta.\nEven before the pandemic, UN-Habitat requested contractors to hire skilled and unskilled workers among unemployed residents of the target areas allowing the job to be done more quickly and supporting local livelihoods.  Providing jobs and income at the height of the pandemic is key to help rural communities in their recovery.\n “It makes me proud and happy that during the lockdown I didn’t have to go deeper in debt,” says Mohammed, who noted that as he already knows many skills, he aims to pay off his debt and buy tools and equipment that will help him do his job better and earn more money as his children grow up. He also wants to build his house that was destroyed during the conflict and cultivate his farmland, which was torched during their displacement. \nSo far, UN-Habitat has created 150 jobs for skilled and unskilled workers from Yathrib through a series of area-based integrated projects. These included the rehabilitation of the Emergency Unit of the local Medical Centre, the extension of the water network to 400 homes, rehabilitation of war-damaged houses and the on-going cleaning of an irrigation canal. All of these interventions are being undertaken within the four-year-long EU-funded programme ‘Supporting Recovery and Stability in Iraq through Local Development,’ implemented by UNDP in partnership with UN-Habitat.\nRead in Arabic\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/returnees-in-yathrib-iraq-help-rebuild-homes-in-their-conflict-affected-communities-during-the", "abstract": "Yathrib, Iraq, 2 July 2020 - While living away from home in Baghdad for four years, 31-year-old Moha..."},

Households can apply for food support and are vetted to ensure the food packs reach those most in need. The vetting process seeks to identify families who have lost all sources of income due to COVID-19, along with those who have existing vulnerabilities, such as family members with disabilities or existing medical conditions.\n“Over the past month we have received over 3,000 applications,” said Danish Ram, Clerical Officer at the Ministry of Housing and Community Development. “We were overwhelmed by the huge demand and had to temporarily stop taking new applications.”\nThe support packs include basic food and hygiene supplies that can last a family of four for two weeks. The Food Bank has so far supported around 300 families from the Central division of Fiji, and most of the 229 UN-Habitat packages will be supporting families in the West. Initiatives such as the Veilomani Food Bank provide critical support to families who have few alternatives in this unstable time.\nIn June 2020, UN-Habitat carried out a rapid assessment of the impact of COVID-19 in 16 informal settlements which found that the income loss has affected households’ food security. Families described having to skip meals or reduce portions because they were worried about running out of food before being able to afford more.\nInga Korte, the UN-Habitat Team Leader for Urban Climate Resilience, said: “We find that incomes have drastically decreased over the past two months, with many households now surviving on less than USD 95 a month. Especially in urban informal settlements people are struggling to meet their food demands as they have limited access to land for farming.”\nThe Government of Fiji declared the country COVID-19 free on 5 June 2020 however Fiji’s borders remain closed for the foreseeable future.

The conference purpose was to assess the state of academic and practice-based knowledge related to cities and climate change, and to establish a global research agenda based on the joint identification of key gaps by the academic, practitioner and urban policy-making communities.\nThis conference was the foundation upon which Innovate4Cities, convened by the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, was launched at the end of 2018, as a city-focused research and innovation initiative that addresses critical data, innovation and technological gaps to enable cities to take accelerated and ambitious climate action. Co-developed by cities, city networks, scientists and research institutions and leading private sector entities, the initiative focuses on the areas most critical to drive climate action in cities. The lecture presents the history and objectives of Innovate4Cities, and unpacks the currently identified research and innovation gaps to meet cities climate action ambition. \n \nShort analysis of the above issues \nInnovate4Cities is facilitated by the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy through its Research and Innovation Technical Working Group (TWG). Through this, TWG city networks and other urban focussed researchers are working together to align efforts and establish a single collaborative research agenda that addresses the identified gaps. This has involved the identification of research ‘gaps’ by analyzing ongoing and upcoming projects from leading city climate organizations, with the purpose of ensuring the efficient use of time and resources, maximizing opportunities for collaboration and minimizing duplication of effort. \n \nPropositions for addressing the issue\nThe intention of this lecture is to emphasize that accelerated and coordinated knowledge generation is essential to best position city climate leaders to implement innovative climate solutions.\n \nBIOGRAPHY\nDr Cathy Oke has over 20 years professional and academic experience in urban sustainability and city leadership.

The increasing use of digital technologies in human settlements and cities offers immense opportunities if well governed.\nSmart technology can contribute towards sustainable development, by reducing carbon emissions and facilitating the ecological transition, increasing access to affordable housing, enhancing participation in policy making for citizens, and ensuring access to inclusive services for communities.\nOur digital future can help to bridge social divides and improve the living conditions for all. The importance of digitalisation in managing sustainable urbanization has been captured in several key guiding documents such as the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda as well as the New Urban Agenda.\nThe UN Development System has anchored digitalisation and technologies as frontier issues in its UN System-wide Strategy on Sustainable Urban Development, with UN-Habitat taking a coordinating and technical advisory role.\nIn this regard, UN-Habitat expanded deployment of frontier technologies and innovation as a key outcome area in its Strategic Plan 2020 - 2023. All documents underline that the benefits of digitalisation need to be channelled towards accelerating efforts to reach the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\nConcrete examples of UN-Habitat’s engagement with partners haves been in the field of transport planning, service delivery and urban safety monitoring. Moreover, in humanitarian contexts UN-Habitat has been coordinating GIS and data-science based urban and neighbourhood profiling in order to prioritize short-term humanitarian interventions and longer-term urban recovery efforts.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic illustrates that digitalisation has the potential to strengthen cities’ resilience in times of crisis. Due to the imposed lockdowns, local governments are providing a series of services online, they are creating digital platforms for neighbourhood assistance and contact tracing apps are being introduced to limit the spread of the pandemic.\nUN-Habitat promotes technologies which are used in an inclusive, resilient and sustainable way while mitigating the related risks such, as unreasonable surveillance or the invasion of privacy.\nThe \"One-UN\" approach and extensive partnerships are vital in order to harness the potentials of digitalisation in an inclusive, resilient and sustainable way.\nUN-Habitat ensures a close collaboration with other agencies in accordance with the UN System-Wide Strategic Document (SWSD) to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development . Partner agencies in the field of digitalisation include, among others, ITU and UNECE in the United for Smart and Sustainable Cities (U4SSC) initiative as well as UNDP. These cooperation efforts prevent overlapping and fill capacity as well as knowledge gaps from individual agencies.\nMoreover, UN-Habitat partners with external stakeholders such as cities platforms, local and national governments, academia, private sector and civil society entities (such as the Cities for Digital Rights Coalition).\nThere is an opportunity for UN-Habitat to take a technical advisory and convening role and bring many of these actors together in a coordinated way to ensure a coherent and inclusive approach to tackle the challenges of an increasingly digitalised world while placing people at the centre of smart city approaches.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/digitalisation-for-inclusive-safe-resilient-and-sustainble-cities-and-human-settlements", "abstract": "Digitalisation, big data, connectivity and Artificial Intelligence are shaping today's cities around..."},

A new push is required to revisit research and educational needs to better plan, design, build and manage cities,” he said.\nThe importance of preparing the new generation for an increasingly complex world through education and research was highlighted by Professor Sahar Attia, Chair of the Habitat UNI Steering Committee.\nModerator Astrid Haas, Policy Director at the International Growth Centre in Kampala, Uganda, focused on the current challenges that universities were facing with the restrictions imposed by the pandemic. Panelists agreed that with on-line learning, universities had to adapt and innovate in their teaching methods to continue engaging students in a meaningful manner.\n“Future curricula need more reflection in order to incorporate new dimensions linked to the impacts of the pandemic and strengthen particular areas of learning and those should be aligned to the SDGs,” said Subrata Chattopadhyay, Professor and Dean at the Indian Institute of Technology of Kharagpur. He said research should help revisiting housing and urban planning standards, livelihood planning, community interaction and social space.\nThe increasing complexity emerging in cities, not only as the results of the health impacts of the pandemic but also the crisis of inequalities, illustrated by the recent protests, was highlighted by Dawn Jourdan, Professor and Executive Associate Dean at the College of Architecture of the Texas A&M University. She said this should be reflected in curricula and teaching and the current crisis was a real opportunity to revisit programmes and the pedagogy itself.\nCamilla Perrone, Associate Professor of Urban and Regional Planning University of Florence, stressed the need to rethink environments, places and methods of interaction and research within universities, and called for this momentum to be used to vigorously address the SDGs and the New Urban Agenda.\n“We need to increase our digital competence and infrastructures to promote online sharing, promote open data and science and multiply sharing platforms to boost capacity. This will require huge investments in research,” she said.\nFinally, Nabeel El Hady, Professor of Architecture and Urban Development, Faculty of Engineering at Cairo University, reaffirmed the need to refocus curricula on essential issues that have emerged during the COVID-19 crisis around air quality, water systems and the value of nature to cities.\n“These issues need to be at the heart of research that should lead to direct operational advice to governments. Climate change and the collapse of biodiversity are the central issues to be addressed,” he noted\nFurther Urban Thinkers Campuses on COVID-19 are being held online in July.

This year’s observance highlights the centrality of housing as a driver for sustainable urban development.\nCurrently, 1 billion people live in overcrowded settlements with inadequate housing. By 2030, that number will rise to 1.6 billion. Action is needed now to provide low-income families and vulnerable populations with affordable housing with security of tenure and easy access to water, sanitation, transport and other basic services. To meet global demand, more than 96,000 housing units will need to be completed every day – and they must be part of the green transition.\n \nThe urgency of improving living conditions has been brought to the fore by COVID-19, which has devastated the lives of millions in cities. Access to clean water and sanitation, along with social distancing, are key responses to the pandemic. Yet in slums it has proved difficult to implement these measures. This means an increased risk of infection, not only within slums, but in whole cities, many of which are largely serviced by low-income informal sector workers living in informal settlements.\n\nOn World Habitat Day, in this crucial Decade of Action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, I call for heightened efforts to promote the partnerships, pro-poor policies, and regulations needed to improve housing in cities.

This sourcebook looks at various areas of urban planning and how health consideration can shape and find answers in urban planning and design.\nDr. Naoko Yamamoto, the Assistant Director General for the Healthier Populations Division in the World Health Organization  said the importance of the urban environment and health had been demonstrated during COVID-19 and called for a collective global effort to address the pandemic.\nDr Yamamoto described how cycling and walking were now being promoted and said previous disasters had led to improved parks and green spaces. She said cities could be champions for healthy, green places by preserving nature, using clean energy and supporting healthy forms of energy transmission.\nPanelist Damià Calvet, Counselor for Sustainability, Catalonia, Spain emphasized the need for density under hygienic situations.\n“Cities will remain the living spaces for humanity and we must plan toward territorial planning where opportunities exist. Urban density is part of the health problem related to climate crisis,” he said. “The crisis has reinforced our commitment to the New Urban Agenda as a key to develop more resilient density as the solution as well as part of the problem.”\n Dr. Oxiris Barbot, Commissioner of the Department of Health, City of New York spoke about the importance of housing.  \n“We see high levels of transmission where there is overcrowded housing and frontline workers and in our response to reduce transmission, we have had to account for importance of housing. Initially we provided safe havens for front line workers and quickly went to providing housing for those discharged from hospital,” she said.\nShe said the city had repurposed unused housing space, used public spaces for field hospitals and hotel rooms to allow people newly identified as being infected to isolate safely.\nShi Nan, the Executive President and Secretary General of the Urban Planning Society of China (UPSC) said they had done a study on density in 300 Chinese cities and did not find a relationship between COVID-19 and density.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-and-who-bring-together-experts-at-hlpf-to-discuss-urban-density-and-disease-transmission", "abstract": "New York 9 July 2020 - UN-Habitat and World Health Organization held a key side event on the sidelin..."},

We redouble this call against anti-black racism during this UN International Decade for People of African Descent (2015-2024), declared as such to promote respect, protection and fulfillment of human rights by people of African Descent.\nAs the Secretary-General has stated, diverse societies require investment in social cohesion against discrimination and inequality by national and local governments and civil society. Cities and governments are confronting change, and with it the opportunity to prioritize respect for diversity and inclusion as a common good and shared responsibility.\nCity populations are diverse, which creates the space to be or become inclusive hubs of social interaction and exchange, and sources of creativity, enrichment and cultural expression. Cities must be planned and managed to ensure the skills, talents and abilities of all people are embraced and fostered so that no one and no place is left behind, and that all benefit equally.\nCalling for an end to racism and racial discrimination is a duty enshrined in the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The UN Charter states that one of the UN’s founding purposes is to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.\n“In the UN, we have known from the beginning that secure foundations for peace in the world can be built only upon the principle and practice of equal rights and status for all peoples, respect and dignity for all,” said Ralph Bunche - a co-drafter of the UN Charter and the first African American man to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.\nThese values are at the core of UN-Habitat’s work for safe, resilient and inclusive cities and human settlements for all, free from racism and all forms of discrimination. Our work on urban issues, including accessible public spaces, slum upgrading and improving tenure security, is underpinned by the principle of working together to address structural discrimination and ensure equal access to opportunities.\nWe all - as individuals and as organizations - have an important role to play as we move forward. Each of us must consistently assert and demonstrate the values of diversity, non-discrimination inclusiveness and mutual respect in every aspect of our lives.

These are home to around 60 percent of the world’s urban population and a third of the global population. The majority (1,038) are in the Asia Pacific region with 444 in China and 191 in India compared to 55 in Nigeria, 61 in Brazil, 144 in the USA and 67 in Russia.\nIt is projected that almost 1 billion people will become metropolitan inhabitants in the next fifteen years and there will be 429 new metropolises by 2035.\n“Today, it is difficult to find a city of more than 300,000 inhabitants that is made only of one municipality,” said Remy Sietchiping, Chief of Policy, Legislation and Governance at UN-Habitat. “Analysis shows that nearly half of cities in the world of this size are made of three, five or more local jurisdictions.”\nThe data is contained in the just-released UN-Habitat’s Metropolitan Data Booklet is the first global database of metropolises based on the 2018 Revision of the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects. It features new information for better understanding of recent and future metropolitan dynamics and offers a comparative analysis on metropolitan numbers and figures in global regions.\nThe Booklet is a contribution to the forthcoming Global State of Metropolis Report currently be prepared by UN-Habitat which will look at the current state of metropolitan areas and identify the major challenges of metropolitan management in terms of policies and legislation, planning, governance, and finance. This will support the implementation of the MetroHUB Initiative of UN-Habitat which promotes metropolitan management.\nThe role of metropolises was one of the key highlights of the working group on the Global State of Metropolis established in October 2019 in Medellin-Colombia, which also met in Abu Dhabi during WUF10 and, which findings have been validated by approximately 50 metropolitan global experts.  More information is available on www.urbanpolicyplatform.org\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/a-third-of-the-global-population-now-lives-in-metropolitan-areas-according-to-un-habitat-research", "abstract": "Nairobi, 23 June 2020 - New data from UN-Habitat reveals there are nearly 2,000 metropolitan areas g..."},

The Content includes context (disasters, climate change, violence, conflict and displacement), themes and issues (such as corruption and coordination), project cycle management tools (from assessment to evaluation) and sectoral responses (such as shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene, and health).\n \nPropositions for addressing the issue\nThis lecture presents ten takeaways for those working in response to urban humanitarian crises. Key takeaways include: capitalise on what cities have to offer; ensure you have the right skills, and be aware of what is achievable; develop and value relationships; be flexible (project management tools); take time to listen (ie do assessments); support locally-driven recovery; and, take the long view (build resilience). Each takeaway is illustrated by examples drawn from recent practice.\n \nBIOGRAPHY\nDavid has worked across the world in development and emergencies. He worked for four years in a disaster management consultancy, eight years for the NGO CARE International, and for eight years was Director of a UK university centre focusing on development and emergencies.

High-quality, accessible urban nature is being increasingly recognized as critical to healthy and equitable cities. Urban conservation planning can provide a powerful tool to reshape cities to strengthen local biodiversity, cultural connections to place, public health, and climate resilience, helping achieve The New Urban Agenda commitment of “adopting healthy lifestyles in harmony with nature.” Yet, little science-based guidance has been available to help urban practitioners strategically and systematically incorporate nature into cities.\n \nShort analysis of the above issues\nCurrent research on urban ecology resides in thousands of journal articles and has been largely inaccessible to urban practitioners. Their newly published report, Making Nature’s City, synthesizes global research on urban ecosystems to develop a science-based approach for supporting nature in cities. In this lecture, Robin and Erica introduce the principles of urban conservation planning and show examples of how cities can work strategically at multiple scales to connect, improve, and expand city greenspaces to better support biodiversity while making cities better places to live.\n \nPropositions for addressing the issue\nBy synthesizing research from cities around the world, Robin and Erica, along with the SFEI, have identified seven key elements that contribute to biodiversity in cities. Together, these elements represent an integrated approach to creating and maintaining urban nature. The elements -- Patches, Corridors, Matrix, Habitat Diversity, Native Plant Vegetation, Special Resources, and Management -- translate ecological processes into practical components that can be implemented through the activities of the diverse public and private entities that together shape the nature of the city. Robin and Erica demonstrate examples of successful implementation of each element from diverse cities and scales and illustrate how these interventions can be scaled up to achieve the level of nature performance that will be needed in cities of the future.\n \nBIOGRAPHIES\nRobin Grossinger is a Senior Scientist at the San Francisco Estuary Institute, where he co-directs SFEI’s Resilient Landscapes program. At SFEI he leads an innovative applied research team in urban ecology and resilience, translating cutting-edge science into actionable planning and design guidance. He is the author of the Napa Valley Historical Ecology Atlas, published by the University of California Press, and his work has been featured by media from National Public Radio to The New York Times. He advises cities, regional agencies, and corporations such as Google on urban ecological design and climate resilience strategies.\n \nErica Spotswood is an Applied Ecologist in the Resilient Landscapes program at the San Francisco Estuary Institute where she leads projects related to urban ecology and ecological resilience. Current projects address how regional planning can integrate with local project-scale design, and how urban greening efforts can be coordinated to contribute to broader regional goals for biodiversity and ecological resilience. Her areas of expertise include urban ecology and plant community ecology. Before joining SFEI, Erica conducted postdoctoral research with Katherine Suding, and received her PhD from the University of California at Berkeley in the department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management. Prior to graduate school, Erica worked for the Wildlife Conservation Society in Central Africa, and as a Peace Corps volunteer in West Africa.  \n \nADDITIONAL READING MATERIAL\nMaking Nature's City:\nhttps://www.sfei.org/projects/making-natures-city#sthash.iRCtpQm1.XGxasMQG.dpbs\n \nSFEI Grossinger Webpage:\nhttps://www.sfei.org/users/robin-m-grossinger\n \nSFEI Spotswood Webpage:\nhttps://www.sfei.org/users/erica-spotswood\n \nFind all Global Urban Lectures videos here. \nSee all Global Urban Lectures full packages (video, synopsis, biographies, additional reading material) here.\nThe Global Urban Lecture series is an initiative by UNI – UN-Habitat’s partnership with universities worldwide.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/making-natures-city-robin-grossinger-and-erica-spotswood", "abstract": "In this lecture, Robin Grossinger and Erica Spotswood from the San Francisco Estuary Institute show ..."},

There are now more than 150,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus across Africa, in all 54 countries, with South Africa and Egypt the worst affected.\nOne of the most pressing concerns for Africa is that over half the population (excluding in North Africa) live in overcrowded informal settlements. In these areas where several people have to share one badly ventilated room, diseases such as COVID-19 spread fast and it is impossible to practice physical distancing whether in homes or outside. Other preventative measures are equally challenging. Only a third of households in Africa have access to basic hand washing facilities and in many informal settlements piped water is a luxury. And as a large majority of the workforce is informally employed, and most cannot work from home, they still need to use public transport and cannot follow social distancing.\nLow-income households are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Low-income groups usually face higher rates of chronic health conditions, such as diabetes or heart problems, and are likely to suffer from illnesses such as diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, malaria and tuberculosis. They also have poor access to health services. For instance, Kibera in Nairobi, one of Africa’s largest informal settlements area, has a child mortality rate two to three times higher than the average of the rest of the city. These conditions can make the coronavirus more deadly for these groups, as the risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 increases with poor health.\nHowever, there are some affordable actions that can help reduce risks of infection in Africa’s informal settlements:\nThere is a wider need to leverage community-driven initiatives. As I have learned from my time as a mayor in Malaysia, communities in informal settlements are resilient because they are close-knit and well organised. Community-based organisations and non-profits can help in multiple ways, for instance, Kenya is working with NGOs and community organizations to implement facilities for mapping, mask making and handwashing. South Africa is developing community driven responses and strengthening networks. Community organisations can identify the most vulnerable in communities and devise practical, innovative ways to support families and disseminate prevention information.\nIn a post-COVID world, cities must be empowered to assume stronger leadership in coordination roles and to take on responsibilities for health and security and the governance and management of public and urban affairs. They need to do this with strong participation of all actors.\nWe need to move towards liveable cities that reduce overcrowding, with affordable, accessible housing, as well as parks and open spaces. Healthy cities would include buildings and transport that promote improved energy efficiency and environmental sustainability and would provide essential services including health to all.\nThe response to COVID-19 in informal settlements provides an opportunity to rethink urban planning and find innovative sustainable ways to eradicate slums. Local authorities will have to be the driving force in reducing inequality, supported by national government policies to leapfrog into a sustainable urban future with safer, more accessible, and more resilient cities.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/fighting-covid-19-in-africa%E2%80%99s-informal-settlements", "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has cost hundreds of thousands of lives in the world’s richest cities but pose..."},

She added that the reporting aims to support local organizers and such projects should expand globally to better reflect the reality on the ground.\nElijah Kanyi, Reporter and Founder of Sauti TV, a community channel based in Mathare, one of Nairobi’s largest slums explained how their programmes have focused on promoting positive stories depicting how people in communities have helped each others during the pandemic. He said community media played an important role by reaching out to groups such as youth living in slums to explain how to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\nAlexander Hecht who works on  the Asia Foreign News Desk at the  Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF), explained the challenges of finding information, understanding decisions made by the authorities and following the analysis and data produced by medical experts.,  He said the media’s role was to simplify the language used medical experts so the public could understand it. And he called for a balance between reporting on local perspectives and global issues and on urban and rural contects.\nAshley Womble, writer and mental health advocate and Director of Communication of Crisis Text Line, explained how her organization supports people in crisis through counselling using a secure online platform based on text messages. The organization shares data on its website.\nJohn Paget and Chris Elisara, Co-founders of First and Main Films producing documentary-style narratives and films said that apart from the daily news cycle, it was also important to appreciate ‘slow’ media  producing documentaries and films that explore and investigate issues, reflect on the future and produce stories with emotional power.\nParticipants emphasized the importance of an inclusive news ecosystem that reaches different levels from global to local, representing varied groups and viewpoints in a wide range of contexts and communities. It is crucial to develop networks of freelancers and local journalists on the ground to help fact checking, interpreting data and numbers and getting local contexts and insights.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/journalists-discuss-the-challenges-of-reporting-during-pandemics-in-covid-19-urban-thinkers-campus", "abstract": "Nairobi, 29 May 2020  - About 120 participants joined the ninth COVID-19 Urban Thinkers Campus sessi..."},

Other challenges included juggling between childcare and economic activities.\nThe data shows that residents in most cities have limited access to handwashing facilities in public places, despite its proven effectiveness in preventing the spread. Nearly three quarters of residents said their cities were implementing targeted rather than mass testing for COVID-19.\nThe series of surveys are being posted online for two weeks at a time as part of the COVID-19 Campaign. They consist of a series of questions on different topics requesting city residents to provide information on what is happening in their cities in terms of COVID-19 infections, testing, prevention and control measures and its impact on their daily lives.  \nThe data and findings will be available for all actors and governments to help with their interventions\nThe Chief of UN-Habitat’s Data and Analytics Unit, Robert Ndugwa said the data is very significant.\n“This COVID-19 Campaign Survey will help understand at a more granular level what is happening at the city and neighbourhood levels. When combined with other ongoing initiatives such as the vulnerability mapping we are undertaking across cities, this data will contribute greatly to UN-Habitat’s COVID-19 Response Plan,” he said.\nThe crowdsourcing data application has been developed in partnership with ESRI, which provides geospatial information solutions software, and will be used to continuously collect data on the COVID-19 city-specific situations while monitoring  measures put in place to control the pandemic and accelerate local recovery. \nEveryone living in an urban area is encouraged to take part in the COVID-19 Campaign Survey by accessing the link here.

The webinars involved a wide range of old and new partners including national and local governments, NGOs, community groups, the private sector, academics, media and many more.\nOne of UN-Habitat’s key roles is to fast-track learning on how cities and communities, particularly in informal settlements and slums, are dealing with the COVID-19 crisis in terms of preparedness, response and recovery. By facilitating structured learning through webinars and online discussions, the agency supports the exchange and identification of innovative approaches and solutions.\nIn May UN-Habitat and partner organizations held nine Urban Thinkers Campuses (UTCS) promoting the COVID-19 Campaign and covering a wide variety of subjects covered including the basic services gap, the shelter gap, the safety gap, the wage gap, community leaders on the front line, planning and design for urban resilience and reporting during the pandemic. Over 1100 participants joined including community and grassroot women leaders, social workers, planners, researchers, scientists, business leaders and journalists with the recommendations  compiled in a report. A second series is taking place in June and July.\nOn 25 March, in collaboration with United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) and Metropolis, UN-Habitat launched #BeyondTheOutbreak, a virtual live learning series for selected mayors, local leaders and stakeholders on areas and 13 sessions have now taken place encompassing gender, finance, culture, migration, mobility, housing and public service workers. Another series is now underway.\nThe ongoing Global Water Operators Partnerships Alliance (GWOPA) webinar series “Water Utilities in the Fight Against COVID-19” is sharing solutions and exchanging knowledge about effective COVID-19 Pandemic responses with water and sanitation operators with topics including how to slow the spread in slums and how to effectively manage the crisis through strategy, assessment and decision-making and attracted around 150 participants each time.\nThe webinar series \"How to continue municipal solid waste management during the COVID-19 pandemic\" explored in four sessions, each attracting 60 to 100 participants, the opportunities and challenges of COVID-19 for solid waste management, zooming in on how to adapt the existing systems during the crisis, how waste workers (formal and informal) need to be protected and how to handle the increased amount of medical waste.\nThe #AfricaUrbanTechSummit digital edition from 26-29 May had over 2000 viewers and was co-organised between Pangea Accelerator and UN-Habitat with  the British High Commission in Kenya, UK Kenya Tech Hub and Habitat for Humanity with iGabantu Studios and brought together tech entrepreneurs, corporates, investors, NGOs, government agencies and other organizations. The digital summit aired on Youtube Live via the Pangea Accelerator platform with follow up Facebook Live sessions on the UN-Habitat Facebook page.  Speakers looked at: Emergency Response During COVID-19; Responsive Technology and Data for cities in Africa; Innovation and Startup resources for urbanization in Africa and Supporting Young Innovators in Housing during COVID-19.\nThe Land Rights and COVID-19 webinar and discussion series, was presented by several organizations including the Global Protection Cluster of which UN-Habitat, is a member. UN-Habitat was on the panel for the Eviction Response during and after COVID-19 session on 27 May. \nThe Global Network on Safer Cities partners’ webinar on 27 and 28 May defined elements of a roadmap of actions leading to the World Urban Forum in 2022 in support of the implementation of the UN systemwide Guidelines on Safer Cities and Human Settlements.\nThe UN-Habitat Urban-Rural Linkages project organized the webinar series “Urban-Rural Linkages in the time of Covid-19” starting in May. The aim is to exchange information and learn from the efforts of different actors to overcome this crisis and enhance post-crisis recovery actions by bringing a focus to urban-rural linkages and integrated territorial approaches. The role of metropolitan governments, small towns and intermediate cities, neighbourhoods and communities and the impact of COVID-19 on slum dwellers and the urban poor in relation to the urban-rural flows of resources, people and capital have been discussed. The fifth session on 4 June on Urban-Rural Linkages in the time of Covid-19: Neighbourhood Governance and Community Response, was jointly organised with the GCRF Centre for Sustainable Healthy and Learning Cities and Neighbourhoods.\nThe virtual Expert Working Group meeting on Global South experiences, challenges and opportunities for managing urban mobility during COVID-19 held on 5 May was convened by UN-Habitat, the World Health Organization and UN Environment Programme with the British High Commission in Kenya, UK Kenya Tech Hub, High Volume Transport, the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, the German Government’s Transformative Urban Mobility Initiative, the Partnership on Sustainable, Low Carbon Transport, the International Association of Public Transport, the Urban Pathways and SOLUTIONSplus projects, Walk21 and the Open Institute. It aimed to share responses in the transport sector in the global south and better understand managing urban mobility and was attended by nearly 770 participants.\nSince 2012, PPS and Placemaking X have been a key partner to the Public Space Programme and Placemaking X have organized two webinars featuring UN-Habitat as speakers/panelists. On 21 April two UN-Habitat staff were part of the panel in the Public Spaces are Essential Services which looked at the challenges and opportunities of spending time outdoors and that  cities are facing regarding safe public space usage. UN-Habitat staff also participated in the webinar on The New Frontlines: Highlighting Actions to Promote Healthier Informal Communities Through Placemaking on 28 May\nThe Webinar “International Forum on Healthy Cities” on 29 May was co-organized by China Association for Science and Technology, UN-Habitat, Urban Planning Society of China and the International Society of City and Regional Planners, More than 500 participants from over 20 countries and international agencies, including senior officials and representatives from Kenya Institute of Urban and Rural Planners, Poland Association of Planners, UNICEF, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and Indonesia’s Ministry of National Development and Planning of Indonesia discussed strengthening international collaboration and promoting healthy city development.  \nAt the opening session UN-Habitat’s Executive Director said the Forum showcased how planning professionals are responding to COVID-19. The experts looked at urban density, improving governance to build safe, resilient and sustainable cities and enhancing the quality of public space.\nA different approach is being taken by the Local2030 Initiative hosted by the Executive Office of the UN Secretary-General and which UN-Habitat is involved in as part of the Secretariat. It launched the Local2030 Spotlight Series inviting all stakeholders involved in the local response to share brief videos on Adequate Housing and Shelter, Urban Basic Services and Livelihoods.\nThese webinars, which are ongoing, are a key opportunity to bring together local community leaders across cities, countries and regions providing opportunities for active learning about local adaptation, preparedness and response, to look at what works and adjust the response going forward.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/thousands-join-un-habitat%E2%80%99s-online-webinars-to-identify-innovative-solutions-for-cities-during-and", "abstract": "Nairobi, June 2020 – UN-Habitat turned the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic into a lear..."},

The neighbourhoods, which are home to Syrian and Palestinian refugees and vulnerable Lebanese, suffer from high rates of overcrowding, unemployment and poverty and many buildings are not connected to the water network.\nTo address unmet hygiene needs, UN-Habitat, through the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), in partnership with the Popular Aid for Relief and Development provided almost 1,000 families with hygiene protection kits with priority given to the additionally vulnerable, including female-headed households, women, girls, the elderly and people with disabilities. The kits, which will allow 4,500 residents to adopt proper hygiene practises for two months, included detergent, bleach, laundry powder, shampoos, soap bars, rubbish bags, surface cleaning cloths and a bucket.\n“This is highly appreciated by the residents of this area, who benefitted greatly from these essential hygiene kits, especially due to the current coronavirus situation,” said Aisha Hergel, a social activist.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/hygiene-kits-reach-most-vulnerable-urban-populations-in-beirut", "abstract": "Beirut, Lebanon, 12 June 2020 – UN-Habitat is rolling out a series of COVID-19 projects in some of t..."},

These included: establishing crisis units, tailoring emergency strategies, adopting adaptation measures, halting cut-offs, and procuring protective gear for staff.\nDuring the three webinars (Lessons from Beyond the Curve, Slowing the Spread in Slums, Crisis Management), over 400 participants highlighted that partnerships and solidarity are essential for utilities to fast-track solutions and avoid costly errors. According to the Ednick Msweli from eThekwini, South Africa, a utility that serves 595,000 inhabitants, “there is always something to learn. It helps for utilities to work together because you can’t have all the answers by yourself.“\nDuring the discussions, utilities representatives and experts from the water, sanitation and hygiene sector underlined that although the pandemic is slowing in some regions, emergency measures bring about secondary challenges such as a shortage of cash flow which must be addressed sooner rather than later. However the ‘silver lining’ according to participants was that huge numbers of previously unserved people now have access to some kind of basic water and/or sanitation service.\nGWOPA, which aims to facilitate peer support and learning between utilities, created the #UtilitiesFightCOVID campaign and webinar series to ramp up peer learning during this crisis.

Pandemic preparedness in cities and towns is more urgent than ever for reducing disaster risk, particularly in challenging situations where disease outbreaks could coincide with an extreme weather event.\nThe eastern Indian city of Kolkata has been devastated by Cyclone Amphan, which caused many deaths and left millions without electric power. Fear of contracting the virus made it impossible to use cyclone shelters to their maximum capacity. COVID-19 restrictions made evacuations more difficult.\nCountries around the world were caught by surprise by the COVID-19 pandemic despite many warnings and recent experience of epidemics such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which spread through urban centres including Hong Kong and Toronto.\nThese recent experiences and others, such as the Ebola outbreak, have led some countries to be better prepared. But generally, there is a lack of planning for hazards and disasters at all levels.\nThe frustrating shortages of personal protective equipment, ethanol for disinfectant and other emergency supplies could have been avoided if there had been adequate scenario-planning at the national level, supported by the allocation of required resources to local governments.\nThe COVID-19 crisis exposes systemic vulnerabilities in healthcare systems that cannot handle surging caseloads. Likewise, cities have been forced to confront the fact that unplanned urbanization creates conditions where many of their residents lack adequate water and sanitation facilities, while living in overcrowded places where physical distancing is challenging.\nIt is now an urgent requirement for cities and towns to develop a deep understanding of their risks from future pandemics, just as they would for other more visible hazards like extreme weather events. \nNEW METRICS\nGovernments, especially at the local level, need to plan and strategize to deal with all hazards, including biological ones, and to address gaps in their preparedness and develop response capacity. This will prevent them being taken by surprise, and then overwhelmed.\nBetter data collection will allow city leaders to prepare for future episodes where once unthinkable metrics become normal, such as whether a park can accommodate neighbourhood residents if they must keep two metres apart.\nThere is an existing framework to manage disaster risk. Over 200 cities and towns around the world already use the United Nations Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) Disaster Resilience Scorecard to develop evidence-based approaches to managing their disaster risk.\nThe Scorecard has been augmented by the development of a Public Health Addendum which provides guidance to local governments on the wider issues of management and recovery in case of biological hazards, including a pandemic. The Addendum to the Scorecard is designed to help cities establish their public-health system resilience baseline and to frame an action plan. It will soon be available as an online course.\nIn cities like Lisbon, Kampala and Greater Manchester, the Disaster Resilience Scorecard has proved to be a useful tool helping cities to establish their public-health system resilience baseline and to frame an action plan. Likewise, UN-Habitat’s City Resilience Global Programme provides hands-on support to local governments in urban planning and building resilience to all types of hazards.\nGLOBAL CAMPAIGN\nThese UN agencies and other partners like the World Bank Group saw the need to prepare for risks like climate change, disease outbreaks, pollution, waste management, land use and building codes when they launched the Making Cities Resilient (MCR) campaign 10 years ago. The campaign has since attracted 4,300 cities and towns to sign up, creating a global network of local governments keenly aware of the need to reduce disaster risk.\nNow, UNDRR, UN-Habitat, the World Bank Group and other partners are joining forces to elevate the campaign’s focus from advocacy to implementation over the next decade. New partners willing to work together for urban resilience are invited to join.                                         \nThe successor campaign, MCR2030, will launch towards the end of this year and pandemic preparedness will be a priority area of focus for all participants, including local governments and municipalities, over the next decade.\nThe focus is on cities because, while they can be disease vectors, it is also clear that sustainable urbanization creates social, economic and environmental prosperity - which can be an important bulwark against the spread of disease.\nIt is a hopeful sign that some of the world’s most urbanized countries are responding with relative success to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSouth Korea, where over 80% of citizens live in cities and towns, applied lessons learned from its experience with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015. It has managed to fight the outbreak using technology, open communication, rigorous testing and tracing, and excellent hospital care.\nCOVID-19, like most epidemics, is largely an urban problem. Local strategies for disaster risk reduction must include pandemic preparedness as a priority, and this needs to be part of the process of better recovery and building resilience to future disease outbreaks.\nFirst published here: https://news.trust.org/item/20200615120207-y321f\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/opinion-covid-19-demonstrates-urgent-need-for-cities-to-prepare-for-pandemics", "abstract": "Joint Piece by UN-Habitat Executive Director and UN Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reducti..."},

The facilities they have put up have resulted in over 500,000 handwashes.\nThe residents of Mathare, and the other one billion people worldwide living in slums, face enormous challenges in coping with COVID-19. Physical distancing is hard in communities that are densely populated.  Mathare has over 60,000 people per square kilometre, its houses are small and overcrowded, and basic services are generally unavailable.\nThe lack of infrastructure and chronic water shortages make handwashing a challenge.\nThe youth of Mathare Environmental One Stop, a UN-Habitat supported youth centre, decided that providing handwashing stations throughout the community, along with prevention information, was the best solution.\nThey reached out to UN-Habitat staff members George Gachie and Linus Sijenyi, who work in Kibera and Mathare, to pitch their idea.\n“I was approached by Isaac Muasa (also know as Kaka or Big Brother), the head of Mathare Environmental, and we discussed how we could implement this project in the informal settlements in Nairobi,” said Mr. Gachie.\n“UN-Habitat has worked extensively with youth and informal settlements globally through our programmes such as the Participatory Slum Upgrading Programme, so we knew how we could partner and support these youth.”\nMathare Environmental convened other youth groups. Twenty youth-led agencies were quickly identified to set up and be responsible for the handwashing stations. New donors were brought onboard, such as Norway and Canada, which agreed to fund 18 handwashing stations, in addition to the 10 funded by Participatory Slum Upgrading Programme and wash basins provided by a private company.\n“By mid-April, we had 28 stations operational in Mathare and the largest informal settlement Kibera,” said Mr. Sijenyi. “We plan to bring another 40 online in the next month and have one and a half million handwashes by the end of August.”\nSupport is being provided by the Nairobi-born former English Premier League player, Victor Wanyama, currently captain of the Montreal Impact, who many youth in Mathare admire.  Through his Foundation, he is providing 10,000 masks made by women tailors in the community and distributed for free at the handwashing facilities.\n“We are proud that we can help our community,” said Roda Ingashani, of the Wonderful Mothers Group, one of the youth groups funded by the Canadian Government which is hosting a Mathare handwashing station.\n“The community is very concerned and feels empowered when given the opportunity to wash their hands and fight COVID-19.”\nThis article first appeared in the UN’s internal website Iseek: https://iseek.un.org/article/kenya-young-people-mobilize-prevent-spread-covid-19\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/young-kenyans-mobilize-to-prevent-the-spread-of-covid-19", "abstract": "June 2020, Nairobi - Youth groups in Mathare, one of Kenya’s largest slums, have banded together to ..."},

It is against this background that UN-Habitat and partners are soon launching a multisectoral guide to support local authorities on migrants’ inclusion at local level. \nThe Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) and the Global Compact for Refugees (GCR) were adopted in December 2018 by most of the UN Member States. Both global frameworks acknowledged the importance of local authorities for implementing and achieving the set objectives. Cities have long played a central role for accommodating and including migrants and are now playing an active role on migration topics in cooperation with national governments, the international community and in partnership with civil society and private sector actors. However, while some local authorities are successfully developing and implementing innovative strategies, others struggle and are in need of guidance, resources and capacity to advance with challenges regarding service provision and inclusion of migrants, refugees, returnees and displaced persons into their urban societies.\nIn 2019, UN-Habitat joined forces with the Center for Mediterranean Integration (CMI), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Conference for Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organization (UNESCO), and the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) to collectively support local authorities in reaching the goals and objectives set out in the two Global Compacts, with a special focus on migrants’ inclusion through local actions and multi-sectorial approaches. The aim of the cooperation is to provide cross-sectoral recommendations emphasizing cities’ growing importance for sustainable migrant inclusion and harnessing the positive impact of migrants’ social and economic inclusion in cities.\nBefore the official launch of the report titled “Local Inclusion of Migrants and Refugees - A gateway to existing ideas, resources and capacities for cities across the world”, the multi-partner group reached out to selected local authorities for feedback on the recommendations and practicability. The survey was conducted in four languages (English, French, Spanish and Arabic) and was shared with local authorities in different regions and cities, including capitals, but also small and intermediate cities. Local authorities were asked to rate the relevance and implementability of each recommendation and provide comments. Recommendations covered topics such as governance, urban and territorial planning, local economic development and entrepreneurship, human rights, protection of children and provision of health services).\nIn addition to the rating, local authorities were also asked to name further areas of support needed to implement the recommendations (e.g. technical advisory services, training and capacity building among others). One final question covered local actions and assumptions on the impact of COVID-19 on the migrant community and other vulnerable groups and the ability of local authorities for further actions. Additional survey results can be found here.\nThe survey results underlined the need for policy coherence, multi-level and multi-sectoral coordination for a reactive, multidimensional, sustainable and effective response to migration related topics in urban settings. Based on consultations with local authorities as main audience for the guide and the survey results, the report will now be finalized, offering concrete examples and strategies for local actions and effective, transformative change at the local level and officially launched in the fourth quarter of 2020. \n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-and-partners-set-to-launch-a-multisectoral-guide-to-support-local-authorities-on", "abstract": "Nairobi, 13 August 2020 - A recent survey among local authorities reveals that cross-sectoral thinki..."},

The participants exchanged experiences and ideas on how the youth can participate during panel discussions, group work, thematic presentations by OHCHR, FAO, UNDP, UNFPA, and many others, as well as interactive artwork sessions.\n‘Informal settlements are disproportionately affected by the pandemic, and climate change brings out and exacerbates existing vulnerabilities’ said Kamsin Raju, one of four FRIS Resilience officers based within an FRIS target municipality. ‘But there is also a lot of potential. For example, youth groups are organizing support for older community members, or there are tutor programmes by older students to help younger children with homework.’\nLed by UN-Habitat, the participants joined hands in painting a mural to express how they experience the pandemic: on one side it tells a story of pain and suffering (the hands symbolize cries for help due to unemployment, rising crime and violence, and food insecurity).

The title ‘Hand in Hand with Youth’ depicts the strong wish of the young leaders to be listened to and included in decision-making.\nThe United Nations Resident Coordinator Mr. Sanaka Samarasinha closed the event by encouraging the youth to claim their rights to participation. ‘This is your UN.

As UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: “We are in this together – and we will get through this, together”, only with an inclusive approach that truly leaves no one behind, the region will be able to overcome this crisis of unparalleled magnitude and proportion.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, either directly or indirectly, millions of people in Latin America and the Caribbean, and refugees and migrants especially women and children are some of the worst affected. Thousands have lost their livelihoods and can no longer afford basic needs such as shelter, food, and health care; others could not continue to pay their rent and were evicted. Women, who are more likely than men to work informally and receive lower salaries, are even more affected. Vulnerable refugees and migrants are now on the streets – where they risk detention for their inability to obey physical distancing measures and comply with quarantines. Others are blocked at borders and need increased and immediate humanitarian assistance. Shocking and violent cases of discrimination and xenophobia have been reported throughout the region.\nAs a result of this context, in some instances, a growing number of refugees and migrants are going back to their origin countries, despite the lack of economic prospects there and the risk of crossborder COVID-19 contagion that such return movements imply. The drop in remittances that comes with the pandemic-induced global economic crisis also affects migrants’ origin countries, thus contributing to worsening living conditions in them.\nThe protection situation remains equally challenging, particularly in border areas. Although the COVID-19 pandemic may oblige governments to implement extraordinary measures to limit the transmission of the virus, it is important to ensure that such measures are following the fundamental principles of human rights, child protection and refugee standards, such as non-refoulment and access to the territory for asylum seekers. The temporary suspension of deportations and the release of refugees and migrants held in detention, especially unaccompanied children, are strongly recommended to prevent the transmission of the virus and protect the health of refugees, migrants, and their communities.\nAt the same time, migrants and refugees continue to show their resilience and contribution to host communities. Working as doctors, nurses, or caregivers, refugees, and migrants, especially women and children, are a vital part of many countries´ public health responses. Many are also an essential part of the workforce in other key sectors of the economy that continue providing services and goods to communities during the periods of quarantine and movement restrictions such as agriculture, food processing and distribution, and cleaning disinfection services.\nTaking into account the vital role and vulnerable situation of millions of refugees and migrants, it is important to consider them in governments’ social protection responses, including targeted and universal measures that can mitigate the pandemic’s socio-economic impact. The UN System is ready to support countries in addressing this challenge and has been working side-by-side with governments and civil society in Latin America and the Caribbean, providing guidance, assistance, and protection to support national responses. “Our concerted action remains more necessary than ever. Only by coming together will we be able to face the Corona virus and mitigate its shattering impact on millions of lives”, emphasized the representatives.\n“Refugees and migrants as well as their local hosts need practical and non-discriminatory access to information, and to adequate medical care. All individuals, no maTTer their migration status, should be included in national systems and services – along with other populations at risk of marginalization or exclusion”, underlined the representatives. “The virus does not discriminate. Everyone is at risk and so, everyone – including refugees and migrants – should be able to access health facilities and existing social safety net programmes during this emergency.” Employers should also make efforts, whenever possible, to maintain workers’ salaries, in particular those at the bottom of the wage ladder.\nIn the framework of the response for refugees and migrants from Venezuela, the Interagency\nCoordination Platform – led by UNHCR and IOM, has revised the Regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan (RMRP) launched in November 2019, to account for new needs since the COVID-19 outbreak. Together with NGO partners, UN agencies are implementing several prevention and response activities in the main locations where refugees and migrants are hosted. These gender sensitive activities ensure people can adequately access information, clean water, soap, and appropriate waste disposal. Organizations are working around the clock to find innovative ways to continue supporting the most vulnerable individuals in the current context, while also supporting national authorities to set up observation and isolation spaces for potential positive COVID-19 cases. UN agencies are also working on livelihood initiatives to help refugees and migrants, as well as host communities, recover from the current health and economic crisis., in addition to supporting measures to ensure the protection of migrant and refugee populations, especially those with international protection needs.\nThe international community must respond to this dire invisible humanitarian crisis. Today, the International Donor Conference, in solidarity with Venezuelan refugees and migrants, was convened by Spain and the European Union, and with the support of UNHCR and IOM. It is essential that donor countries find ways to continue supporting humanitarian and protection response by hearing and responding to the voices of the most vulnerable. Unless the international community more strongly supports host countries, there is a high risk that millions of Venezuelan refugees and migrants in Latin America and the Caribbean, especially women and children, will be left behind, increasingly invisible during the pandemic.\nFor more information\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/covid-19-must-be-addressed-through-international-solidarity-and-cooperation", "abstract": "UNSDG LAC Joint Statement \n26 May 2020 - UN agencies part of the United Nations Sustainable Developm..."},

The project brings together Planet Smart City and the Participatory Slum Upgrading Programme (PSUP), a partnership initiative of the African Caribbean and Pacific group of States Secretariat, the European Commission and UN-Habitat. Planet Smart City will use its expertise in technology, data analytics and community engagement alongside UN-Habitat´s technical expertise on slum upgrading to deploy digital and on-the ground solutions that empower slum communities to coordinate locally-led initiatives and raise living conditions.\nSince 2008, the PSUP has been working to achieve the Sustainable Development Agenda, in particular Sustainable Development Goal 11.1, which, by 2030, aims to ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services, and upgrade slums. This partnership will use the broad experience of the PSUP in slum upgrading and gather lessons learnt from leveraging private sector engagement for improving the living conditions of the one billion slumdwellers worldwide. \nAt the heart of the initiative is Planet’s proprietary Planet App, a mobile platform that will act as a digital hub for community engagement. Through the app, slum residents will be able to access news and services, including materials for the prevention of diseases, as well as book medical point services and borrow shared tools and equipment. Moreover, the app will serve as a platform for local coordination, allowing residents to organise community initiatives, participate in savings groups and view a calendar of activities and educational courses.\nCore to the long-term goal of realising financial independence for slum community members, the Planet App will also be deployed to support local entrepreneurship, giving a platform for residents to coordinate and promote their services both within their communities and to the wider area around the slum. It can also be used to link slum community members to employment and training opportunities in Nairobi.\nThrough this partnership, Planet will also support communities to develop a community hub where events and activities can take place. Planet and UN-Habitat will work in collaboration with local partners, community champions and NGOs such as Shining Hope for Communities and Slum Dwellers International (SHOFCO), to collect and analyse data on the needs of local residents. This will allow the organisations to engage collaboratively with local people on the design and implementation of new community services and resources.\nData analysis and the tailoring of the app will be supported by the PSUP team on-the-ground in coordination with Planet’s experienced community manager, Elena Fabris. Their aim will be to engage local people and more effectively empower their initiatives utilising digital tools. This participatory approach will allow the slum communities to evolve according to local priorities and with a high degree of community ownership.\nGiovanni Savio, Chief Executive Officer at Planet Smart City, said: “We have built our company on two core beliefs: the fundamental right of every person to an inclusive, safe and sustainable home, and the conviction that through the adequate scale, smart technology, digitalisation, resilient infrastructure and intelligent urban planning we can make this a reality. From Brazil to Italy to India, we have not only developed innovative ways to benefit the lives of our residents, we have learnt from them about how better to engage and empower local voices in a process of continual improvement. \n“It is incredibly exciting to put our learnings to use with UN-Habitat in the service of communities for whom our innovations and expertise can have a transformational effect. With African cities growing by 40,000 people every single day, the need for safe, comfortable and affordable homes is pressing. As we continue to build insights into the rich communities and complex challenges across the continent, we hope to expand the services we can offer people in its many diverse nations.” \nAlan Marcus, Chief Digital Strategy Officer at Planet Smart City, said: “Africa is in the midst of one of the world’s most exciting technological metamorphosis, with Kenya right at the heart. The country is already the world leader for mobile money penetration and connection to mobile services has surged from 30 per cent of the population in 2009 to over 50 per cent last year.* The forces of innovation that are transforming lives in both Kenya and across the continent can be harnessed to empower the people of African nations. \n“All of us at Planet are energised by the prospect of working with UN-Habitat  to ensure this digital revolution in Africa is an inclusive one. Slum communities are tight knit, resourceful and brimming with potential—if we give them the tools, these communities can be the catalysts for real and long-term transformation.”  \nKerstin Sommer, Manager of the Participatory Slum Upgrading Programme of UN-Habitat, said: “With the COVID-19 momentum, we all need to play a part for a bigger mission to improve the living conditions of the most vulnerable in our cities. That won’t work without the contribution of the private sector.”\n*GSMA, March 2020\n \nPress Contacts \nJanaína Campoy\nj.campoy@planetsmartcity.com\n+44 (20) 7887-4525\n \nAndrew Leach / Lucy Wollam \nplanetsmartcity@hudsonsandler.com\n+44 (20) 7796 4133\n \nSusannah Price\nsusannah.price@un.org\nMobile number +254 722 719867\n \nAbout Planet Smart City \nProptech company Planet Smart City designs and builds smart, afordable neighbourhoods that provide more than just homes.

The webinar, organized by the Urban-Rural Linkages team in UN-Habitat, featured three speakers and four discussants, all of whom are experts and practitioners in the area.\nRafael Forero, Urban Policy & Metropolitan Expert from UN-Habitat and moderator of this session, pointed out the importance of metropolitan areas in the fight against COVID-19.\nMario Silva, Managing Director of the Metropolitan Planning Institute of the Metropolitan Area of Guadalajara (IMEPLAN), Mexico gave the example of the metropolitan area of Guadalajara, whose dominant use of land is agricultural. He introduced that nutritional programme are included as part of the COVID-19 response measures to create stronger linkages between urban and rural areas within the metropolis.\nGabriel Voisin-Fradin, Project Manager for International Economic Relations, Grenoble-Alpes Métropole, France then took the floor and emphasized the importance of partnerships with different stakeholders. He introduced that Grenoble Alpes-Metropole has usually worked with many partners (municipal, departmental, regional and state government). And in the face of the pandemic, new partnership with universities, hospitals, and the private sectors have been formed and strengthened. He also raised the question of how to maintain and take forward these partnerships in a post-COVID world. Both the Guadalajara case and the Grenoble case show that previous metropolitan policies regarding rural areas can contribute to a better response to COVID-19.\nLia Brum, Metropolis Observatory Officer, Secretariat General, World Association of the Major Metropolises, pointed out that most of the initiatives related with urban-rural linkages at the metropolitan level are led by city governments located in the peripheral areas of metropolitan territories. These initiatives are related to food supply, water supply, waste management, mobility, security and policies to tackle gender violence. She then stressed that no solution can be found without collaboration, and irritated in metropolitan spaces, the collaboration of central cities and peripheries can make a difference to ensure that quality of life is not further threatened. \nJuan David Palacio, Director of the Metropolitan Area of the Aburra Valley, drew the audience’s attention to the role metropolitan areas play in the protection of biodiversity. The Metropolitan Area of the Aburra Valley, together with 5 metropolitan areas (and other local and subnational governments from 12 countries, and 129 partners) signed the Aburrá Valley - Medellin Declaration of Metropolitan Areas to the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. In the declaration, metropolitan areas call for the consideration of urban rural linkages and for the equitable distribution of resources to maintain ecosystem services in both urban and rural areas.\nThis is the second webinar of this series. The first webinar of this series took place on Monday, May 4th, 2020, with speakers from China, Colombia, and the US discussing the current range of Covid-19 mitigation and post-Covid-19 recovery measures through the lens of urban-rural linkages.\nFor more information on previous webinars and upcoming ones, please visit  http://urbanpolicyplatform.org/url-webinar-series/\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/webinar-urban-rural-linkages-in-the-time-of-covid-19-metropolitan-perspectives", "abstract": "Nairobi, 14th May 2020 – Over 220 participants joined the second Urban-Rural Linkages webinar “Urban..."},

The harsh realities of gender inequality are particularly obvious in slums where the population is most at-risk and least prepared. \nMost countries have responded to COVID-19 with shelter-in-place orders, lockdowns and measures to curtail the spread. But slum-dwellers have a hard time complying, as their overcrowded housing often lacks basic utilities, like water and sanitation. For women and girls who are slum-dwellers, the challenges are even greater as they face increased domestic violence (already being reported) and unpaid care burdens. \nWomen aged 15 to 49 are overrepresented in urban slums and slum-like settings in 80% of the 59 developing countries analysed in a paper Spotlight on Goal 11: Harsh realities: Marginalized women in cities of the developing world. produced by UN Women and UN-Habitat.\n In Kibera, Kenya, the world’s fourth-most-populated slum – and where COVID-19 cases are highest in East Africa – there are 116 women for every 100 men. The figure is 120+ women per 100 men in Gabon, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti and Lesotho. In 61% of the 59 developing countries analysed, more than half of women aged 15–49 live in slums. \nThe paper shows that women in slums are worse off than their male slum and female non-slum counterparts in access to employment, health facilities, secure housing and education completion. COVID-19 and its aftermath are only expected to worsen such outcomes and increase extreme poverty. \nMost women in slums work, but it tends to be low-paid, temporary, strenuous and exploitative, making them more likely to be ‘working poor’ (employed but earning less than $1.90 a day). Many are domestic workers who can’t render services remotely, thereby losing income that enabled them to feed their families. For example, in Brazil, within the first month of the pandemic, 39% of domestic workers had been fired without payment. In India, millions of women casual workers and their families have been stuck in cities without any income or food.\nAs the pandemic hits low- and middle-income countries, it is critical that the response acknowledge underlying inequalities that place women at even greater risk.  \nAccording to WHO COVID-19 prevention guidelines, staying at home, handwashing, maintaining good hygiene and practicing social distancing is advised. However, 1.2 billion urban-dwellers globally lack access to hygiene and handwashing facilities and 2.2 billion urban-dwellers lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities (see Figure 2). In the Kibera slum, residents have one latrine for 50 to 150 people.\nMost urban-dwellers without access to safe handwashing and sanitation live in developing countries, where women and girls collect water in 80% of households. They go to crowded community pumps or unprotected water bodies, care for the sick, take young children to latrines and walk long distances in search of firewood – which increases their exposure to the virus through public interaction and being in unhygienic spaces for a prolonged time.\nOther essential services such as public transportation, on which women rely, are also lacking. There has been a large drop in public transportation services in many global capitals, alongside huge spikes in the cost of the few available.\nIn Jakarta, Indonesia, a rapid assessment found that 90% of transgender women surveyed were at high risk of contracting COVID-19 due to their living in cramped slums. In Lebanon, social workers and psychologists are reporting higher rates of gender-based violence in slums, during COVID-19.\nMoreover, with schools closed and no access to Internet in most slums, girls will be hit the hardest. Even if remote learning is possible, many girls in these settings bear increased domestic and care responsibilities that limit their remote learning activities. \nUltimately, the worst-affected by the pandemic will be those facing multiple and intersecting deprivations. Women and girls in slums face the double whammy of greater exposure to the virus, given their limited access to hygiene and space, while each day of lost income and education multiplies their vulnerabilities and pushes them further behind.  \nTo avoid heightening already stark social inequalities, policymakers must consider the gender profiles of slums as a first step towards reflecting the needs of women and girls in their strategies. Now, more than ever, we need exemplary solidarity to leave no one behind and prioritize the most marginalized and vulnerable. Emergency response plans must target the urban poor, including slum-dwellers, migrants, the homeless and especially women and girls within these vulnerable groups, who often face even greater challenges with less voice or resources to withstand the impacts.    \n \nAuthors \nGinette Azcona is a Research and Data Policy Specialist at UN Women. \nAntra Bhatt is a Statistics Specialist with UN Women’s Research and Data Team.\nRobert Ndugwa is the Chief of the Data and Analytics Unit of UN-Habitat\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/covid-19-exposes-the-harsh-realities-of-gender-inequality-in-slums", "abstract": "As the pandemic hits low- and middle-income countries, it is critical that the response acknowledge ..."},

Urban growth was also responsible for 16% of natural habitat lost between 1992-2000, and more than 80% of people living in urban areas that monitor air pollution are exposed to air quality levels that exceed WHO limits.\nAt the same time cities hold the key to change these trends, and cities around the world have started to do so. Protecting and restoring the environment is not just a moral duty; nature supports our societies, cities and economies and is our greatest ally in solving the climate challenge.\nNature in and around cities have shown to be effective solutions to reduce heat island effects, provide flood control and purify air. Nature makes good public spaces great, opens cityscapes for green oases, providing fresh breezes and shading. If public green space is well managed and expanded, it can help reduce CO2 emissions and improve air quality. Nature provides us with oxygen, purifies drinking water, ensures fertile soil, and produces the variety of foods we require to stay healthy. Nature provides the foundation of many industries and livelihoods. It helps mitigate climate change impacts by storing carbon, providing flood and landslide protection, and regulating local rainfall. Life on earth would not be possible without nature’s services. It is our greatest common good.\nGiven our increasingly urban lifestyles, cities influence humanity’s relationship with nature, and are key in the transition towards a carbon-neutral and nature-positive world. Science has never been clearer on the impact of human activities on nature and the consequences we will face, as stated in a series of major intergovernmental scientific reports (e.g. IPCC, IPBES) demonstrating the crisis of accelerating nature loss.\nWhile the physical space cities occupy might be small, the ecological footprint of cities, due to our consumption and lifestyles, is of far greater magnitude leading to biodiversity loss in the periphery of our cities and further afield. It is estimated that between 2000 and 2030, this can threaten 290,000 km2 of natural habitat. A well-connected network of green spaces, or biodiversity corridors, in and around a city, together with a conscious effort to reduce urban sprawl, can do much to mitigate the impact that the city has on nature in its region.\nWorld Environment Day provides an opportunity to rethink how our cities have evolved and the impact they have on the environment and biodiversity. Living in harmony with nature can only be achieved if we reverse biodiversity loss and pursue full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. World Environment Day celebrations will help build momentum and unite the global community in actions for positive change, even as we tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and the emerging recession.\nCities for People and Planet\nSustainable Development is a journey that we must travel together, and together we can propel our cities towards that goal. The warning signs detailed within the 2016 Global Cities Report, 2018 Living Planet Report and in other scientific sources need be addressed; and these are slowly being translated from global agreements into powerful policy mandates for change. But we need to act faster and at scale. Fossil fuel use and the resulting emissions are the dominant components of humanity’s climate footprint, rising steadily, while natural resource consumption and agriculture account for the largest portion of biodiversity footprint. The ecological footprint per capita of high-income countries remains about five times that of low-income countries.\nEnsuring widespread access to nature and its ecosystem services has significant positive impacts on equitable development. Improving urban green spaces, especially in informal settlements and lower income neighborhoods, can profoundly improve the quality of life for the urban poor who lack personal and public space, and encounter bad air quality. In addition, urban agriculture has the potential to help green cities and contribute to food security, especially for the most vulnerable who may lack access to fresh food products.\nThe first-ever UN Biodiversity Summit, to be held in September 2020, gives us a great opportunity to renew our focus on Nature and People, and to take action in a high-level forum at the onset of the Decade for Ecosystem Restoration and several key environmental policy negotiations in 2021.These negotiations, which include talks on a new global biodiversity framework, increased climate action and a renewed commitment to the environment under the Sustainable Development Goals, represent a momentous opportunity for world leaders to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, securing a sustainable future for people and planet.\nHow nature and cities can thrive together\nWe all critically depend upon healthy interconnected ecosystems, so it is essential that nature is fully integrated into urban planning, design and development. We need to accelerate the protection of public green spaces, particularly in dense neighborhoods, for enhanced recreation, temperature regulation, and air purification. Urban and territorial planning provides a framework to align and transform our built and natural environments. Putting human and environmental health at the heart of urban and territorial planning process and principles will enable the full potential of our cities and territories to deliver healthier and resilient environments. Livable, compact and mixed-use cities, based on sound urban policy and planning, are a solution to counter the tendency of sprawl, slowing the expansion of peripheral towns, that are expanding spatially much faster than their populations, and are much more dispersed and segregated as a result. Associated habitat destruction and land conversion is rapidly increasing, a real disaster for biodiversity.\nCities are drivers of the transition from a linear to a more circular economy. Cities bring together resources, ingenuity, knowledge and capital in ways that shorten distances, spur innovation and consolidate infrastructure, which in turn reduces per capita rates of resource use. Integrating energy, food, water, waste and transport systems (e.g. urban parks that double as safe bike lanes, or biogas produced using food waste) will reduce the associated biodiversity impact inside and outside city boundaries. The construction industry, in collaboration with local/ regional governments, can lead the transformation of the built environment to make it healthier and more sustainable with longer building lifespans, reuse and recycling of building materials, waste and water, and design for energy efficiency.\nWe currently face an interconnected health emergency and a planetary emergency. Over the next 12 months we have a unique opportunity to rethink our relationship with the natural world, and to set nature on a path to recovery for the benefit of people and the planet. On World Environment Day with the theme of celebrating biodiversity, we need to analyze, act, and accelerate for a healthy city as we look at a green recovery approach\nPlanetary health and our urban future are closely inter-connected. We need to secure the transformative potential of cities. As set out in the New Urban Agenda, national governments should fully embrace their role in supporting preparedness and response in cities. This shift will require dialogue on rebalancing the roles of the public and private sector to ensure adequate service delivery to all, and particularly the urban poor. As governments adjust their national planning efforts to stimulate economic recovery in light of COVID-19, there is a unique opportunity to focus on critical infrastructure, nature restoration, and healthy urban systems that create a wide range of jobs and drive a sustainable transformation.\n \nJennifer Lenhart, Global Lead, WWF Cities\nMarcus Mayr, Programme Management Officer, UN-Habitat\nAlso published on https://medium.com/@WWF/lets-make-the-world-s-cities-a-little-greener-bbe48847c3f\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/joint-un-habitat-and-wwf-cities-blog-for-world-environment-day", "abstract": "Let’s make the World’s Cities a little Greener\n6 June 2020 - Today, 55% of the world’s population li..."},

However, these simple preventive public health measures are almost impossible to follow for those who are homeless, or who live in unsafe or overcrowded conditions.\nIn the face of this pandemic, the lack of adequate housing has repercussions on society as a whole and is a direct threat to everyone’s health and safety. Ensuring secure housing for all and the provision of essential services are crucial components of national efforts to contain the spread of the pandemic and prevent the loss of life.\nUN-Habitat applauds the efforts of the numerous national and local governments that have issued bans on evictions and instituted moratoriums on payment of mortgages and rents, and those that have continued providing for the needs of their residents and communities.\nHowever in some countries and cities, evictions and relocations continue. These principally affect the poorest and most vulnerable populations living in deprived neighbourhoods, informal settlements and slums.\nSuch evictions and relocations are a violation of the fundamental right to adequate housing and protection against forced eviction enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. They also create significant additional risks in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nMember States have an obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the right to adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living. Denying residents and communities this right during the COVID-19 pandemic can have devastating consequences.\nThese include increased exposure to COVID-19 and other infections in addition to exposure to insecurity and violence, the loss of income and limited access to socio-economic safety nets and basic services including health care.\nThe relocation and eviction of long-term residents and communities, particularly from informal settlements, during the pandemic would not only violate their fundamental rights, but could also expose both them and the rest of the local population to an increased threat of exposure to the virus.\nTherefore, UN-Habitat urges Member States and governments at all levels to stop all relocations and evictions at this time.\nIn exceptional cases where relocations or evictions are unavoidable, for example to prevent new land invasions, they must be conducted in accordance with international human rights obligations, as well as the relevant national laws, and the maximum possible protections should be provided to ensure the health and safety of those affected. In such exceptional cases, evictions must, at a minimum:\n \nUN-Habitat also urges national, regional and local governments to:\nUN-Habitat is available and ready to assist national and local government in these efforts, including by investigating and devising alternative solutions and mitigating measures for the residents of informal and low-income communities.

Where they once squeezed into shared vans and matatus or rode the bus rapid transit lines in Dar es Salaam, and Cape Town, they are now limiting their trips.\nWorldwide, the use of public transport has declined up to 90% since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Urban planners and transport managers fear that COVID-19 could have a lasting impact on public transport and accelerate the region's unsustainable move toward car ownership.\nThis is an opportunity to improve public transport across the continent. Such investments will improve African urban mobility in the long run, avoiding the massive traffic jams characteristic of so many African cities, and keep the climate-friendly improvements in air quality that have marked urban life during the past two months.\nTransport contributes about a quarter of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions and is the fastest growing source of carbon dioxide. African emissions only account for 5% of the global total, but they are the second-fastest growing in the world after Asia. Between 2000 and 2016, they increased by 84%. As part of the Paris Agreement in December 2015, African countries committed to accelerate action to improve and enhance public transport. Now is the time to make good on that promise.\nCOVID-19 has demonstrated the need for a strong urban public transport system to move essential workers. Ideally this would combine good facilities for walking and cycling that are integrated with a bus, tram or rail-based public transport system. People should also be able to walk or cycle comfortably and safely to reach common neighbourhood destinations like shops, pharmacies, schools and workplaces.\nAs lockdowns are eased, several cities are already putting in place new dedicated bike lanes aiming to allow a degree of mobility while maintaining physical distance guidelines. In cities such as Addis Ababa, Nairobi and Kampala, UN-Habitat has, in the past, worked with governments and NGOs to provide bike lanes and re-design streets and public spaces to integrate them with public transport. As cities recover from this crisis, such work will be even more important.\nWalking is the most popular mode of transport in cities. In UN-Habitat's headquarters city of Nairobi, more than 40% of all trips are made on foot. But often footpaths and pavements are narrow and falling apart, making walking difficult and unsafe. Better quality, wider pavements will enable neighbourhoods to accommodate physical distancing mandates for the foreseeable future and provide a healthier walking environment for pedestrians.\nMass transit should also be transformed. Many African countries use minivans to provide the only public transport service available, but authorities find it challenging to impose safety standards, particularly the current hygiene and sanitation guidelines, or control fares.\nMany cities, including Dar es Salaam, have demonstrated how informally-operated transport can be transformed into an efficient public transit system with modern and well-maintained buses on dedicated lanes. This transition can be achieved without the loss of jobs as the existing paratransit operators consolidate themselves into professionally-managed business entities.\nElectrifying buses would also further reduce air pollution and emissions. Widespread adoption would turn the air pollution improvements seen during the pandemic into permanent benefits. Facilitating the adoption of electric bikes and smaller electric vehicles as feeders to the main services can further reduce emissions and extend the reach of public transport.\nA modern public transport system and better footpaths and cycling lanes will also make roads safer – this would be a very important benefit in Africa which has the highest number of fatalities of any global region at 26 deaths per 100,000 population.\nWith COVID-19 forcing many to adopt remote work habits, a permanent increase in teleworking can reduce travel demand and commuter traffic. Africa has a growing tech start-up and service economy which can benefit, however for many people, particularly in the informal sector, working from home is not an option.\nAs African countries consider fiscal interventions to stimulate their falling economies, governments should prioritize interventions that improve urban systems to reduce the need for car travel and expand public transport. Public transport not only provides a safe means to travel to work, as an industry it employs many people and creates jobs. As businesses grow along public transport routes, it also contributes to further economic development.\nWe have a window of opportunity to learn from this crisis and build back better by making our public transport systems more resilient and responsive to future crises. African countries should aim to emerge from the pandemic stronger and ensure their public transport systems are clean, green and ready to go.\nFirst Posted here: https://allafrica.com/stories/202005260875.html\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/africa-how-urban-mobility-can-come-back-stronger-in-a-post-pandemic-world", "abstract": "Nairobi — With much of Africa currently in or beginning to emerge from COVID-19 restrictions, city d..."},

This is part of the “Covid-19 Response As We Rebuild Marawi Initiative” funded by UN-Habitat’s Global Emergency Response Fund.\nWhile some restrictions have eased, there are still limitations in travelling and transportation of goods in the Philippines which makes access to food difficult. While the impact of COVID-19 is felt across the country, it is magnified in areas recovering from conflict, such as Marawi, where in 2017 a siege by militants against Government forces displaced thousands of families.\nThe two satellite markets introduced under the UN-Habitat’s initiative operate daily in the barangays (villages) of Sagonsongan and Boganga, which are part of the city but far from the functioning city centre. The satellite markets serve over 2,000 internally displaced families in transit sites along with other families living there. Buying from the satellite market saves travel time and decongests central markets. \nThe Initiative works with cooperatives and homeowners’ associations covered by UN-Habitat’s existing post-conflict shelter project, Rebuilding Marawi through Community-driven Shelter and Livelihood, funded by the Japan Government.\nThese partner beneficiary groups manage the satellite markets and provide vehicles to use as  mobile stores in 10 villages outside the city centre reaching hundreds of families.  Rice, vegetables, canned goods, and other daily household necessities can be bought from the stores on specific days of the week.\nThe Initiative covers the cost for the inventory, volunteers’ allowances, transport, and other costs for the markets and stores so these will not be passed on to customers.\n“We aim for families to get the food and essential items they need at the lowest cost possible, at wholesale prices with no mark-ups as UN-Habitat is already covering the other operating costs, while also eliminating transportation and other related costs when people have to go to markets,” says Christopher Rollo of the UN-Habitat Philippines office. \n “In times of crisis the tendency is for prices to increase, products become more expensive.

The webinar, which attracted over 380 participants, was organized by the World Urban Campaign with the participation of  urban planners from ISOCARP and its Institute, Arcadis NV, the Commonwealth Association of Planners, the Paris Region Institute and the Urban Lab of UN-Habitat.\nExperts started by highlighting the central role of urban planning in the post COVID-19 recovery and the unique opportunity to start rethinking the way we plan cities.\nEric Huybrechts, regional planner at the Paris Region Institute said that large cities have been at the epicentre of the crisis, starting with Wuhan. He said as cities continue to grow such pandemics are increasingly inevitable and new planning and design approaches are essential to prevent and adapt to future crises, protect citizens and prepare for upcoming pandemics.\nOne of the critical aspects of future planning will be to incorporate informal settlements, said Mr Huybrechts, and planning for the increasing majority of urban poor that have been impacted by the pandemic. While this will one of the biggest challenges that urban planners will face, the pandemic can also be an opportunity to accelerate the shift towards the ‘green new deal’, he said.\n‘Planning for flattening the curve should be at the heart of urban planning’ said Bert Smolders from Arcadis NV, a firm engaged in urban infrastructures around the world which is  working with UN-Habitat to assist cities to respond to the pandemic through a Rapid Response Help Desk. Mr Smolders said Arcadis is thinking strategically about resilient planning approaches for the long term to ‘build back better’ after the crisis towards a ‘safe and attractive new normal’. However, he added that the task is complex because we have to make secure health-proof cities while preserving the livability and freedom citizens have enjoyed so far. \nIan Tant, the UK Vice President of the Commonwealth Association of Planners emphasized that the crisis represents an opportunity for planners to fully incorporate climate action, redefining green space in cities and revisiting the way city centres are designed for business. Cities should adapt to changing ways people work, travel and shop. Four essential avenues to rethink cities, Mr Tant said, are through new housing standards to make people safer and healthier, promoting active travel through non-motorized transport, improving green spaces and reshaping city centres.\nIsocarp, a global network of urban planners is actively engaging planning professionals in learning from the pandemic and looking at ways to increase urban resilience, rethinking pubic space and introducing a new health consciousness in future planning.\n‘Public space has been ‘traumatized’ in this pandemic, suffering from new social distancing protocols. This requires a major shift’, said Milena Ivkovics, Coordinator of Urban Planning Advisory Teams at Isocarp. The Isocarp Institute, led by Didier Vancutsem, is looking at ways to build the future capacities of planners through adaptative, flexible and integrated approaches to designing and planning cities.  A new dialogue will be essential in the coming years by engaging citizens and training young planners to address the challenges.\nJavier Toner, Urban Development Specialist at UN-Habitat said planning should be revisisted through regional, city, neighbourhood and building scales which all require new thinking. He said cities need the right densities and public spaces, mixed-use compact neighbourhoods integrating urban agriculture, as well as buildings with adequate space and standards.\nAt the end of the session, planners said it was important reflect on the thinking of the different planning associations and practices, as well as focus on key areas such as urban mobilities and public space.\nEight Urban Thinkers Campus sessions have been held this month with the last in this series  on ‘Reporting during pandemics’ being held on 29 May.

To flatten the curve of COVID-19 infections, this call of duty is now emblazoned on t-shirts, in street art and a celebrity hashtag.\nBut for the 1.8 billion people around the world living in homelessness and inadequate shelter, an appeal to “stay home” as an act of public health solidarity, is simply not possible. Such a call serves to highlight stark and long-standing inequalities in the housing market. It underscores that the human right to shelter is a life or death matter.\nThroughout this global pandemic, governments are relying on access to adequate housing to slow the viral spread through self-isolating or social distancing policies. Yet, living conditions in poor or inadequate housing actually create a higher risk of infection whether from overcrowding which inhibits physical distancing or a lack of proper sanitation that makes regular hand-washing difficult.\nAt the most extreme, people experiencing homelessness must choose between sleeping rough or in shelters where physical distancing and adequate personal hygiene are almost impossible. Homeless populations and people living in inadequate housing often already suffer from chronic diseases and underlying conditions that make COVID-19 even more deadly.\nIt is now clear, housing is both prevention and cure – and a matter of life and death – in the face of COVID-19. Governments must take steps to protect people who are the most vulnerable to the pandemic by providing adequate shelter where it is lacking and ensuring the housed do not become homeless because of the economic consequences of the pandemic.\nThese crucial measures include stopping all evictions, postponing eviction court proceedings, prohibiting utility shut-offs and ensuring renters and mortgage payers do not accrue insurmountable debt during lockdowns.\nIn addition, vacant housing and hotel rooms should be allocated to people experiencing homelessness or fleeing domestic violence. Basic health care should be provided to people living in homelessness regardless of citizenship status and cash transfers should be established for people in urgent need.\nSteps should be quickly taken to establish emergency handwashing facilities and health care services for at-risk and underserved communities and informal settlements.\nIn many cities and countries, emergency measures are already moving in this direction.\nBerlin opened a hostel to temporarily house up to 200 homeless people, catering to all nationalities. The Welsh government pledged GBP10 million to local councils for emergency homeless housing by block booking empty lodging like hotels and student dormitories.\nIn South Africa where under half of all households have access to basic handwashing facilities and in Kenya, where it is under a quarter of households, governments are increasing access to water for residents living in rural areas and informal settlements by providing water tanks, standpipes, and sanitation services in public spaces.\nMany jurisdictions, such as Canada’s province of British Columbia, have suspended evictions. The eviction ban means landlords cannot issue a new notice to end a tenancy for any reason and existing orders will not be enforced.\nSpain, France, the United Kingdom and the United States have announced mortgage postponements in an effort to curb potential defaults.\nNational and local governments are also working with the private sector to tackle housing issues. For example, Singaporean firms with government backing are providing accommodation for Malaysian workers who had been commuting to Singapore daily.\nAnd as they are no tourists in Barcelona, the city has agreed with the Association of Barcelona Tourist Apartments to allocate 200 apartments for emergency housing for vulnerable families, homeless people and those affected by domestic violence.\nSome cities are leveraging citizen solidarity. Residents of Los Angeles are making hand-washing stations for homeless people living in a depressed area known as Skid Row which are installed and maintained by a local community centre.\nAll of these urgent measures and more are desperately needed and demonstrate the way in which housing is inherently connected to our collective public health. These successful interventions also show concrete ways that governments and communities can effectively tackle the pre-existing global housing crisis – a crisis which affected at least 1.8 billion people worldwide, even before the pandemic.\nIn 2018 the European Federation of National Organisations Working with the Homeless reported that homelessness had skyrocketed across the continent. In the United States, 500,000 people are currently homeless, 40 per cent of whom are unsheltered.\nIn April last year, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) warned that rent is currently the biggest expense for households accounting on average for one-third of their income. In the last two decades, housing prices have grown three times faster than incomes.\nThe current global housing system treats housing as a commodity. In times of crisis, the inefficiencies of the market are clear with the public sector expected to absorb liabilities.\nThis is not sustainable and many cities are struggling to find shelter for their citizens. COVID-19 has brought into sharp relief the housing paradox – in a time when people are in n desperate need for shelter, apartments and houses sit empty. This market aberration needs correcting.\nGovernments are at a crossroads. They can treat COVID-19 as an acute emergency and address immediate needs without grappling with hard questions and fundamental questions about the global housing system.\nOr they can take legislative and policy decisions to address immediate needs, while also addressing the present housing system’s structural inequalities, putting in place long term ‘rights-based’ solutions to address our collective right to adequate shelter. Housing must be affordable, accessible and adequate.\nCOVID-19 is unlikely to be the last pandemic or global crisis that we face. What we do now will shape the cities we live in, and how resilient we will be in the future.\nFirst posted here: http://www.ipsnews.net/2020/05/housing-prevention-cure-covid-19/\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/housing-is-both-a-prevention-cure-for-covid-19", "abstract": "By UN-Habitat Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif and Leilani Farha, the former UN Special Rappo..."},

Public workers on the frontline have carried out their essential tasks, which have been critical to support the implementation of sanitary measures.  The thirteenth thematic live learning experience paid attention to the important role of public workers and to hear the perspective of local governments and workers experience as the first line of public provision.\nParticipants highlighted the importance of social dialogue and solidarity as critical aspects for the recovery and underscored the importance of building and maintaining alliances between local governments and workers in order to come out of the crisis with a renewed outlook on the importance of taking care of workers.\nThe session was introduced by Rosa Pavanelli, Secretary General of Public Service International (PSI), who argued that the work of PSI, as a union, had been focused on recognising the fundamental rights of workers. She expressed the need to “build an alliance between workers and local governments to carry out preparedness approach for our communities. We need to be bolder, and dare more in asking for the role that local governments can fulfil”.\nAndré Dizkus, Chief, Urban Basic Services Section, Global Solutions Division of UN-Habitat explained the challenges that many public workers have in working from home and called for them to be  valued and recognised. He relayed a message from the Executive Director of UN-Habitat, Maimunah Mohd Sharif, who stated that “compassion and solidarity are necessary to tackle this crisis, as are local and regional governments and their work in caring for public workers.”\nEmilia Saiz, Secretary General of UCLG, argued that, in order to defend public services, a partnership between worker organizations and local and regional governments is needed, to publicise the threat to the sustainability of public services.  She commended the partnership with Public Service International as the way forward. “It will be critical to guarantee the sustainability of public service delivery, and this includes improving the precarious jobs and the under resourced services. The recognition of some jobs as essential, including those that have been outsourced, will need to be part of the equation if we want to create resilient systems,” she said.\nEdgardo Bilsky, Director of Research of UCLG facilitated the first roundtable, centring on the need for social dialogue for strong, resilient local public services, in which participants highlighted social dialogue undertaken during the crisis. Armand Béouindé, Mayor of Ouagadougou, highlighted measures taken by the city to protect public workers, such as allowing more public employees to work-from-home and increasing turnover between staff in the town hall, as well as reducing working hours.\nPilar Díaz, Mayor of Esplugues de Llobregat, and Deputy Councillor for International Relations of the Barcelona Provincial Council, called for local authorities and workers to work together to find the formula to address the current situation, and highlighted the social dialogue endeavours in Esplugues as a way forward. Malika Yerlanova, Deputy Mayor of Nursultan, laid out the measures in her city to deal with the social crisis, in particular by providing groceries to people who needed them, and providing grants to create new jobs and maintain old ones.\nJuneia Batista, Head of the National Women Secretariat, Central Única dos Trabalhadores and Union of Municipal Servants of Sao Paolo (SINDSEP-SP) Executive, Brazil described the difficult situation for public workers in Brazil, in particular those at the frontline. She outlined action taken by public work organizations to guarantee that more people could work in public services and reduce the toll on services that were under stress. Mads Samsing, Chair of the Standing Committee of the European Public Service Union for Local and Regional Governments Standing Committee Chair and HK Kommunal Vice Chairman, argued that the measures to contain the virus, however necessary, have left an economic crisis and that public services, collective bargaining and social protection have been and will continue to be critical to contain and recover from the health crisis.\nNicoletta Grieco, Head of the International Office of Italian General Confederation of Labor CGIL Funzione Pubblica, highlighted the experience of social dialogue in Italy during the pandemic to secure the safety and security of all workers, in particular those of the waste sector and others on the frontline.\nThe second roundtable, on Local public service continuation and workers’ safety in times of COVID-19 was introduced by Daria Cibrario, Policy Officer for Local and Regional Governments, PSI. It opened  with Jon Richards, Head of Local Government, UNISON the UK’s Public Service Union, who argued that the flexibility of local governments had allowed for fluid communication among workers and institutions, and called for securing funding for local governments to build back better after the crisis.\nMi-Jeong Park, Senior Specialist of Goyang City, in the Republic of Korea, highlighted how the local government had worked to reduce the spread of the virus, and carried out emergency dialogues with hospitals and collected opiniona from workers to ensure their safety despite all the challenges.\nBernard Dreno, Occupational Health and Safety Specialist, French Democratic Confederation of Labour, argued that the crisis has made it possible to learn by setting up organisations that could become sustainable and to enrich the role of institutional and administrative players. Mauricio Zanin, Advisor of the Confederation of Municipalities of Brazil, highlighted the response from mayors in a country in which the pandemic was not widely recognized, by ensuring funds for health, social assistance, and even funeral care.\nMakrem Amaria, General Secretary of the Tunisian General Labour Union for Municipalities, argued that securing financial resources for local governments, and strengthening the capacities of municipal actors and local elected officials and guaranteeing public services would be critical for the recovery phase. This was echoed by Carlos Carrión Crespo, Public Service and Utilities Specialist of the ILO, who also argued that local and regional governments need to take measures to protect those that are most vulnerable.\nThe wrap-up was conducted by Octavi De la Varga, Secretary General of Metropolis, who pinpointed how the recovery in the post-COVID era needed to differ from that of the financial crisis of 2008, which dismantled many public services. He further argued that it is essential to shift how local governments, and societies handle human resources, and called on local governments and all stakeholders to be creative, and for the establishment of a mix of local, regional, and national public workers to deliver these essential services for the populations.\nCities were called to upload their experiences in the platform www.citiesforglobalhealth.org where over 400 cases can be found.\nThe live learning exercises will continue next week, with a session on accessibility.\nAbout Live Learning Experience Series:\nThe Live Learning Series hosted by UCLG, Metropolis, and UN-Habitat, has brought together more than 2,000 participants over the course of ten sessions in which participants from local and regional governments, the UN system, and partners from civil society shared their experiences, initiatives, and actions to support their communities facing the pandemic through the provision of key basic services.\nThe series started late March and cities across the globe have shared their experiences, initiatives and actions in response to the pandemic.

The volunteers were trained in digital data collection using the ‘Kobo Collect’ App,  an open source app customized to allow collection of location data on facilities and partners’ offices using GPS coordinates. The app can also collect data on the condition of the facilities, their reliability and the services they offer to the community.\nThe informal settlements in Kenya are at particular risk of seeing a rapid spread of COVID-19 due to the overcrowded conditions and lack of places to self isolate or handwashing facilities.\n “Once we understand the availability and distribution of basic facilities and resources in an area we can assess the risks and the required interventions,” said Robert Ndugwa, Head of Data and Analytics for UN-Habitat.\n“The success of our COVID-19 responses in informal settlements will depend on how well we understand what our partners do, where they operate and how they do it,” said Thomas Chiramba, Senior UN-Habitat Officer in charge of Kenya. “Equally, there is need to understand and coordinate activities of different partners working in these informal settlements if we are to maximize our impact during the response phases.”\nThe data will be used to produce maps on the distribution, concentration and functional status of facilities to compare with the existing demand in the areas covered.  The data will enable the Kenyan Government and the county governments to identify key gaps where services are most needed.  The analysis will show areas which are at a higher risk of COVID-19 spread based on the availability of basic services such as water, sanitation and handwashing.\nThe mapping of partners will provide a full picture of the level of support from various organisations and will contribute towards improving partner coordination, service provision and community engagement in informal settlements.\nIn the coming weeks, this UN-Habitat-designed rapid survey will be extended to mapping the services and partners working in other informal settlements in Nairobi, Kisumu and Nakuru counties.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/un-habitat-maps-out-facilities-and-partner-services-in-kenya%E2%80%99s-slums-to-support-covid-19-response", "abstract": "Nairobi, June 2020 – UN-Habitat is working with partners and community volunteers to collect data on..."},

Organized by the World Urban Campaign, the webinar brought together over 80 community practitioners from different regions and faiths in a lively debate.\nSri Sofjan, Co-Chair of the World Urban Campaign and representative of the Huairou Commission emphasised the need to develop new ways of recognizing the role of  grassroot communities and to amplify bottom-up processes in decision-making. She said the fundamental role of community leaders had been demonstrated during the pandemic and they have become indispensable partners in the humanitarian space in urban areas.\n“The pandemic has triggered an unprecedented crisis that is much more than a health crisis,” said Eric Berg, Chairman of Habitat Norway, a voluntary, non profit advocacy and information association. He said this was the result of the lack of attention to the urban poor by decision makers and development agencies in the last five decades. This crisis should be seen as an opportunity to give a stronger role to community organizations because they know how to reach the most vulnerable.\nDavid Boan, Director of Relief and Development and COVID-19 Global Task Force at the World Evangelical Alliance, an international organization with a Special Consultative Status in the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, said governments need to work with organized communities and their leaders, including faith-based organizations who can reach out to large groups, mobilise and share information.\n “They represent a voice of hope for all and compassion for vulnerable groups,” he said explaining that such platforms are effective in disseminating the right messages and adapting to different faiths to reach different audiences.\nMulti-faith platforms and networks represent vast networks of health and education services and represent trusted intermediary between government and local communities explained Nadyia Hussain, Violence Reduction Unit Delivery Manager, Education and Faith Lead at the West Midlands Police Office, UK.\nViolet Shivutse, Chair of Huairou Commission and Coordinator of the Shibuye Community Health Workers in Kenya, said community leaders had to come up with new ways of working quickly, training people on using new technologies to communicate remotely on emergency measures and translating government guidelines in simple language to explain the risks in the most remote places. She said they had to adapt quickly to respond through health care, food distribution, farming or education.\nNew communication and tracking tools have emerged as fundamental to the work of community leaders. Lana Finikin from Sistren Theatre Collective, a grassroots organization in Jamaica, explained how her group started to use safety audit tools to identify danger zones, advising on improvements and empowering women to alert others on safety issues. Using mobile phone apps, they have been able to gather information and assess the needs of the most vulnerable in order to deliver care packages to residents that required specific support and  medication, particularly to the elderly.\nJosephine Castillo, National Programme Coordinator of DAMPA Philippines, a federation of 230 women grassroot organizations, explained how they have build a space to exchange ideas  to improve delivery on the ground  with local governments.

The city-region plans are representative of the creative spatial planning solutions being developed in Palestine, combining the strategic development dimension with the spatial considerations at the governorate level. The plans are a critical component in the realization of the National Spatial Plan (2050) and are harmonized with the National Policy Agenda (2017-2022) and are considered the founding basis for the National Urban Policy project planned to start in 2020.\nThe plans aim at fostering urban and rural development linkages from a spatial perspective, whilst also accommodating for population growth and examining fit-for-purpose arrangements for social services. Over 70 per cent of Palestinians live in urban settings and the rest are living in refugee camps and rural hinterlands.\nThe plans offer a platform through which the private sector, international organizations, and the levels of government can combine efforts and pool funding for the realization of the development interventions prioritized, benefiting approximately 1.5 million Palestinians in Hebron, Ramallah and Al-Bireh, and Jerusalem governorates.\nIn his foreword, Majdi Al Saleh, Minister of Local Government calls for \"proper planning adopting a participatory approach\" which he said includes active involvement of all actors from community members and civil organizations.\nThe Governor of Hebron Jibreen al-Bakri, said: “This ambitious strategic plan reflects the true reality of the capabilities, possibilities, needs, and obstacles of achieving development in general, and the best means to maximize the development components within the available resources”.\nLaila Ghannam, Governor of Ramallah and Al-Bireh stressed the vital role of joint efforts for achieving sustainable development: “The purpose is to unify the development efforts made by various institutions, for what is in the interest of the governorate in general, and achieving our ambitions for development and prosperity”.\nAdnan Ghaith, Governor of Jerusalem accentuated that the plan will be a bedrock in “enhancing the resilience of Jerusalemites and supporting all developmental sectoral institutions in various fields”.\nThe executive summaries of the plans can be found in the below links:\nHebron Governorate– Arabic / English\nSpatial development strategic framework Hebron governorate 2030\nRamallah and Al-Bireh Governorate – Arabic / English\nSpatial development strategic framework Ramallah and al Bireh governorate 2030\nJerusalem Governorate– Arabic / English\nSpatial development strategic framework Jerusalem governorate 2030\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/new-publications-on-urban-rural-linkages-in-the-west-bank-palestine-published", "abstract": "Ramallah, West Bank 18 May 2020 - UN-Habitat and partners launch three new publications to strengthe..."},

He commended the involvement of the signatory cities of the Compact and laid out the roadmap of the Cities4All initiative and the Global Compact for the coming year.\n“We need to have a continued advocacy, sharing experiences through continued dialogue. It is critical to overcome data deserts and lack of actionable responses to bring about the change that we need,” he said.\nThe first roundtable, centering on the experiences of local governments was addressed by Ibnu Sina, Mayor of Banjarmasin, who showcased the special multi-stakeholder taskforce developed by the city, which had considered vulnerable groups including persons with disabilities, older persons and the urban poor, and prepared  social safety nets to distribute assistance and food to those who need it the most. Cid Torquato, Commissioner, Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities, Sao Paulo, highlighted that the crisis of the COVID-19 outbreak also presented a window of opportunity to adopt the digital transformation, and how teleworking could provide an opportunity for many people with disabilities and diminish prejudices.\nDr. Bushra Al Mulla, Executive Director Department of Community Development, Abu Dhabi laid out the actions taken by the city and how Abu Dhabi had endeavoured to protect its most vulnerable in the workforce by providing work-from-home options to pregnant women and persons with disabilities even before the lockdown, as well as providing homeschooling options.\nImen Ouardani, Vice Mayor of Sousse, addressed the impact of the pandemic on migrants and, in particular, migrants who were in precarious situations due to the pandemic, and laid out the work being done in the city to ensure the economic reintegration of migrants and to improve access to public service, digitalization, and information for all.\nVictor Calise, Commissioner, Mayor's Office of People with Disabilities of New York City, described efforts made by the city to reach out to persons with disabilities, through disability service facilitators and a disability specific website to help provide resources for people who need assistance. The issue of education was also deemed critical to ensure equal access which is why, he stated, the department of education worked to ensure the materials were available on accessible digital formats.\nThe city of Montevideo, represented by Fabiana Larisa Goyenche, Director of Social Development, underwent a drastic change in thinking around disabilities, focusing on the issue of accessibility and the responsibility of the local government to eliminate barriers for persons with disabilities and address the social emergency that arises from the pandemic. Johanna Seppala, Head of Participation and Information Unit in the City Executive Office, Helsinki, explained how the local government had developed the Helsinki Aid initiative, to provide aid to older persons and the people most in need.\nCharlotte McClain Nhlapo, Global Disability Advisor of the World Bank shared the work of the World Bank’s disability unit, focusing on two key commitments: ensuring disability-inclusive public facilities, and access to disability disaggregated data. She called on participants to answer the survey provided by UCLG and World Enabled, to gather data on accessibility in times of COVID-19.\nKristine Lange, Programne Specialist, Disability Inclusive Humanitarian Action, UNICEF, explained how the crisis had forced the agency to rethink service delivery. The pandemic has affected children with disabilities, and in particular those living in institutions. The work of UNICEF has been geared to ensuring children have access to education and information in the midst of the pandemic, and how it is critical to work to adapt curriculums. She commended the level of commitment to accessibility in the pandemic, and stated that it is necessary to ensure this commitment in the aftermath.\nThe wrap-up was presented by Octavi De la Varga, Secretary General of Metropolis, who argued that the session had hammered home the necessity of ensuring access. The COVID-19 pandemic, he argued, had further showcased how persons with disabilities are a heterogenous group of people with diverse needs, and that the outbreak provides us with an opportunity to rethink how we are developing policies and to bring about a true transformation in how we access public services and how we deliver basic services.\nCities were called to upload their experiences in the platform www.citiesforglobalhealth.org where over 400 cases can be found.\nThe live learning exercises will continue next week, with a session on local democracy.\nAbout the Live Learning Experience Series:\nThe Live Learning Series hosted by UCLG, Metropolis, and UN-Habitat, has brought together more than 2,000 participants over the course of ten sessions in which participants from local and regional governments, the UN system, and partners from civil society shared their experiences, initiatives, and actions to support their communities facing the pandemic through the provision of key basic services.\nThe series started late March and cities across the globe have shared their experiences, initiatives and actions in response to the pandemic. They also shared their frontline views on how cities may transform beyond the outbreak.\nAbout United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG)\nUCLG is the global organization of local and regional governments and their associations that represents and defends their interests on the world stage.

He started off by acknowledging the key role played by local authorities in addressing the challenges created by COVID-19 despite the shrinking revenues and lack of adequate human and technical resources.\nThe discussion revolved around the impact of the pandemic on economic development and industrial transformation, the role of local governments, the resilience of municipal finances and role of financial institutions and the need to increase housing supply beyond the pandemic.\n “The lock down is really hitting the lowest paid people in African cities who are working in the informal sector. They often live in the most overcrowded areas where they can not protect themselves from the pandemic and there is no work to enable them to feed their families,” said Oumar Sylla, acting Director of UN-Habitat's Regional Office for Africa.\n The Chief of the Urbanization and development Section at UNECA, Edlam Yemeru said: “The effect of COVID-19 on African economies has been quite severe. We can expect 29 million people to fall into poverty as a result. 19 million jobs will be lost across formal and informal sectors.”\nJean Pierre Elong Mbassi, Secretary-General UCLG Africa explained that: “The fight against the pandemic is not only financial, economic and health-related. The sociological and anthropological aspects must also be taken into account. Many people don't understand the rush in burying their loved ones that has been imposed in some countries. Africans have a very intimate bond with their ancestors and want to give the dead all the attention and consideration they deserve during the funerals. However, the management of the fight against the pandemic has not given sufficient thought to this aspect.”\n“COVID19 will impact cities more than other areas. The amount of tradeable activities and the share of slums in cities makes this inevitable,” said Dmitry Pozhidaev, Regional Technical Advisor, UNCDF who was another panelist.\nMuhammad Gambo, Manager in charge of Policy, Research and Partnerships, Shelter Afrique stressed the fact that “construction of affordable housing can act as a catalyst to kickstart economies by providing investment in infrastructure and creating jobs.”\n“COVID-19 is an emergency sitting on top of other emergencies. Focusing on affordable housing could be a way of getting people back to work and could also address the gaps in our cities,” said Stefan Atchia, Chief Urban Division, AfDB.\nCommenting on the Report’s finding that women are the most affected, Yinka Adeyemi, one of the participants stated \"We need to upscale collaborative partnerships with women organisations that work closely with communities.

A youth group, known as Mathare Roots Youth Initiative, came up with the idea after hearing about similar work in Sierra Leone during the Ebola outbreak.\nThe youth were inspired during a UN-Habitat training for youth groups managing hand washing facilities in the informal settlement funded by the agency’s Participatory Slum Upgrading Programme in Mathare. The training featured some the best practices used by young people to raise awareness and pass messages and information to people in Sierra Leone.\nThe youth group said they were also inspired by the graffiti art seen on the vans used as public transport known as ‘matatus.’ The murals, painted on the walls of buildings, feature messages stating ‘End Corona’ and ‘Corona is Real’ mainly written in Kiswahili and Sheng, the informal language widely used in urban areas.\n“We decided to put the art about the pandemic in public spaces such as areas close to taps and public toilets. As a result, people are now conscious about hygiene practices such as washing their hands,” said Lucas Odhiambo, a youth leader at Mathare Roots.\n“As a youth group, we are hoping that the government will scale up these initiatives by youth.  Through this initiative, we are creating a platform for upcoming creative artists to use their talents to contribute to fighting against COVID-19. And we are providing important information to combat the rumours about COVID-19.”\nIn the informal settlements there is widespread misinformation about COVID-19 and a lack of trust in information coming from the authorities.

This particular crisis is unfortunately also aggregating in humanitarian contexts and places such as refugee settlements where systems are particularly fragile; placing huge pressure upon communities who are among those least well-equipped to cope. Displaced communities living in camp/camp-like settings often suffer from pre-existing marginalization, inequalities and vulnerabilities now compounded by this emergency. They now face increased risk due to intense overcrowding, limited (or no) capacity for physical distancing, sub-standard shelter, as well as poor nutritional and health status which can be exacerbated by assistance modalities involving large crowds.\nUN-Habitat’s work in Kalobeyei and Kakuma in Turkana County, Kenya focuses upon supporting refugees and their hosting communities, aiming to improve access to basic service infrastructure, shelter and socio-economic opportunities through spatial profiling and planning interventions. The support to these communities continues to be based upon the premise that development trajectories in the long-term will be affected by the support received in humanitarian contexts and operational decisions made “now”. As COVID-19 presents a global humanitarian crisis, the urgent need for effective humanitarian and development collaboration and coherence is more relevant than ever. Furthermore as scarce resources become increasingly strained, and the nature of this challenge places pressure on national and local governments globally, it is imperative that COVID crisis response interventions serve a dual purpose - both to support partners and communities to cope with this response and to fundamentally build-in improved systemic resilience to shocks.\nThe ongoing work in Turkana takes an urban systemic lens and leverages grassroots community networks through which to target humanitarian preparedness planning, inform a) recovery planning; and b) improved infrastructure investments to enable robust pathways to self-reliance and sustainable development for the wider community. Linking humanitarian and development initiatives, the team is re-contextualising spatial profiling methodologies developed in partnership with UNHCR and piloted in Uganda and Ethiopia to quickly realise multiple dividends. In the context of COVID, a rapidly developed reliable baseline of information to inform targeted and coordinated interventions to combat potential spread of pandemic and guides directed support to vulnerable groups is proving increasingly essential. The spatial profiling methodology utilises rapidly developed analysis leveraging existing information, platforms and partners to reduce transaction costs and improve coordination to inform both the humanitarian response as well as to support in developing evidenced based spatial strategies linked to longer term legacy scenarios.\nDuring this emergency phase, the methodology identifies risk hotspots through a process of spatial data analysis. This includes mapping an overlay of access routes, areas with high population density and clusters of facilities that draw crowds (e.g. distribution centres, water points, marketplaces). In these areas, physical distancing (alongside other mitigation measures) can be put in place to limit the potential risk of spreading infection. Running in tandem is analysis to identify the pockets of vulnerable populations who are located far from services or face access barriers and may need support interventions to ensure provision of service in the case of a potential infection. The findings help in identifying immediate support needs and revealing infrastructure weak spots and systemic gaps which can inform medium/long term interventions. Through working with both host and refugee populations and by bringing a holistic lens to the response, UN-Habitat is uniquely placed to tap into both large-scale data to run spatial analyses as well as community-based field teams to ground strategic perspectives with grass roots realities.\nThis approach also allows for the incorporation of wider development considerations to guide incremental improvements and particularly reduce the long-term risks faced by displaced populations. The strategic infrastructure analyses can focus on bolstering settlement resilience by identifying potential opportunities to plug gaps in infrastructure and enable access to wider socio-economic opportunities, improved service provision and employment.  \nUN-Habitat’s work in Turkana County is expressly aligned with both the UN’s Global Humanitarian Response Plan and the Framework for the Immediate Socio-Economic Response to COVID-19, which supports local capacities in working towards the attainment of the SDGs. The profiling information helps to outline spatial demand, streamline the management of crisis situations and form consensus around prompt action. This enables both a response to the crisis now, whilst maintaining a focus upon providing safe and dignified living conditions for displaced populations whilst protecting hosting communities and building a path towards improved socio-economic opportunities for all.\n\"Spatial Assessment Tool project funded by European Union Trust Fund\"\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/covid-19-in-vulnerable-contexts-spatial-profiling-for-adaptive-responses-in-kakuma-kalobeyei", "abstract": "Despite the inevitable nature of pandemics such as COVID-19, the health and socio-economic impacts h..."},

The project activities focused on enhancing the capacities of youth to meaningfully engage in peacebuilding and governance activities by establishing safe spaces for youth to raise their voices and create tangible mechanisms for their direct participation in the development of policies and programmes at the local level, particularly in the cities of Kismayo, Dollow and Baidoa.\n“In particular, the youth forums conducted by the project in Baidoa laid the foundation for youth in the state to meet with government officials as well as youth from the districts to discuss the role of youth in political processes and the positive contributions they can make towards governance, decision-making and rights of young persons in the context of the Somali Provisional Constitution,” said Osman Nur Adan, one of those recently elected into parliament.\nBorn and raised in Diinsoor Bay Region of Southwest State, and who holds a degree in Public Administration,  Adan says that he has never seen a stable political situation in this region.  The social, political and economic exclusion of the youth which has been prevalent over the last two decades is what made drove his interest into politics.  Citing that the youth lost the confidence that the traditionally male dominated systems of government would one day be more inclusive, he says that “ If we want change, we have to push for our voices to be heard and part of doing that is to participate in the political processes, milestones which the project has helped us achieve.” \nSimilary, Amina Omar, a holder of a Management and Administration degree from University of Somalia (UNISO) in Mogadishu City represents a community in the Southwest Parliament which is under the control of Al-Shabaab. The lack of education and access to basic needs for life that young women and girls face is what drove her to participate in politics.\n“I had to challenge the perception from my community and even from members of my own family who felt that women should not be participating in politics in just for the sake of it,” she says.\n“As a new the greater their access to information and knowledge in particular on decision-making platforms..   .\nThis joint-project is an initiative of UN-Habitat and UNFPA, supported by the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund as part of the Youth Promotion Initiative.  It is implemented in coordination with the Federal Government of Somalia Ministry of Youth and Sports, and Ministers of Youth from the Federal Member States of Jubaland and South-West, as well as youth representatives from the respective regions.\nThe project has been well placed to address the challenges on state building and peacebuilding by putting in place the mechanisms for broader youth inclusion through capacitating youth regional networks, strengthening the capacity of local authorities to engage and respond to the needs of youth and through embedding governance experts to tackle the exclusionary social dynamics on political participation.  As a result of these efforts, the project interventions have changed the attitudes of decision makers and their constituencies in the locations.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/harnessing-the-voices-of-youth-to-increase-democratic-space-in-southwest-state-somalia", "abstract": "Mogadishu, 6 May 2020—An initiative of UN-Habitat and sister UN agencies has seen an upsurge in the ..."},

Making cities function in the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic is proving to be the biggest challenge. The fallout from the pandemic will lead to many new norms once cities start bouncing back and moving towards the recovery path.

She described how the Federation had proposed to the Government to re-pave some roads in informal settlements to ensure water supplies and allow ambulances to move around.\nThe Informal Settlements Upgrading and Relocation Lead at Freetown City Council, Sierra Leone, Sibyl Harleston, called COVID-19 an “invisible enemy” which many in the city saw as being worse than Ebola. She said the COVID-19 response was based on behaviour change messaging and support, isolation and containment which required engaging community leaders. \nProf. Marie Huchzermeyer from Wits University, South Africa also emphasized the important role of civil society.  “Community organizations that are structures of communication and decision-making within informal settlements, onto which systems of reciprocity are often built are key to building resilience and had been under stress,” she said\nThe important role of women as health and care workers taking care of the sick, recognizing the needs of the community and winning their trust and delivering food and supplies was highlighted by Giulia Maci, Urban Specialist at Cities Alliance. She said it was essential to engage women in defining post-COVID-19 recovery plans, including with economic measures to protect and stimulate the economy, from cash transfers to credit loans targeting women .\nSmruti Jukur from the Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centres, India, said the crisis had focused attention on long standing problems in informal settlements such as water, sanitation, healthcare and overcrowding which would have to be addressed to avoid future pandemics.\nHousing can reduce people’s vulnerability and provide an asset according to Lucy Livesley, Director of Market Transformation at REALL, an innovator and investor in affordable homes in Africa and Asia. She spoke about houses requiring space for physical distancing, clean water and a toilet providing safety and security within resilience and vibrant communities.\nKerstin Sommer, Coordinator at UN-Habitat, outlined the approach taken by the Participatory Slum Upgrading Programme(PSUP) in the COVID-19 crisis combining “the immediate responses with the long term recovery strategies, particularly through  partnerships between people, private sector, informal sector.”\nShe said they were advocating with governments to integrate informal settlements and slums in their responses, sharing innovative approaches among partners, working with national government to ensure communities were involved in the design of national policies and protocols for informal settlements.\nParticipants agreed that the role of communities and their leaders is crucial in the immediate response and in the next steps from the immediate recovery plans to long-term resilience.\nA total of nine Urban Thinkers Campuses on COVID-19 will be held online in May to discuss current actions on the ground in different contexts, analyze good practices and solutions, extract lessons from the crisis and make recommendations for building resilience.

Many of these “new poor” will be people living in cities and who are self-employed, mostly working in the informal sector. Cities are on the front line of coping with the pandemic and its lasting impacts.\nResidents of slums and informal settlements are particularly vulnerable. The one billion people who live in slums and informal settlements lack infrastructure and basic services, including water, sanitation, waste collection and access to basic health care. Many rely on communal water and toilet facilities, which accelerates infection rates.  Physical distancing is often impossible in these overcrowded areas. Many residents in these communities have irregular income and unstable jobs, and are unable to put food on the table amid lockdown policies. There are no social safety nets to support them and their families.\nAgainst a backdrop of mounting vulnerability and increasing needs, both national and local governments are confronted with severely strained financial resources. Lower exports, a decline in tourism revenues and remittances, and an acute contraction of economic activities are translating into a precipitous drop in tax revenues. We expect local authorities to have 15% to 25% less revenues next year, making it difficult to maintain current levels of service delivery, let alone invest in improving slum areas.\nCities must fight COVID-19 in three different – and often overlapping – phases:\nEmergency phase\nCities play a critical role during the emergency phase by supporting health care services, maintaining basic infrastructure and providing services, raising public awareness on hygiene and how to slow down the infection rate, and providing support to those whose livelihoods have been affected.  And in the many areas where governments’ social protection registries are not up to date, cities need a place-based approach targeting slums and informal settlements that house the urban poor as well as the “new poor” whose livelihoods have been affected.\nThe city of Buenos Aires, Argentina, for instance, is focusing on the enormous challenge in informal settlements. In Barrio 31, the city scaled up communication efforts, including via WhatsApp and Facebook, as well as awareness campaigns. Care is prioritized for at-risk persons, including those in overcrowded housing and older people, who are offered relocation to hotels and other facilities to allow for physical distancing as a preventative measure. Special attention is given to women and children at risk of increased domestic violence through a focus on early detection, scaled up social services, and sensitizing of neighbors. Additional support includes meals for school children, food distribution to poor households, and community kitchens.\nPoor people whose livelihoods has been affected need access to safety nets, including cash and food. In India, the government of Uttar Pradesh is providing income support to informal workers who lost jobs due to the pandemic, including food vendors, rickshaw drivers, and construction workers. The city of Quito, Ecuador, has scaled up distribution of food through mobile municipal units and food markets.\nVulnerable groups need special attention to prevent further deterioration of living conditions. Several countries such as El Salvador have introduced temporary moratoria against evictions for those unable to pay rent or their mortgage, as well as policies to prevent utilities from disconnecting services such as water and electricity to those unable to pay their bills. In Peru, the city of Lima has provided temporary shelter for its homeless population, in addition to distributing food for vulnerable groups.\nAnother hard-hit group are those working in the cultural and creative industries. Confinement policies have resulted in the closure of museums, opera houses, and restaurants and forced the cancellation of public events, festivals, and shows. To safeguard this sector, which is central to its identity, the city of Melbourne, Australia, launched a grant program to support artists whose livelihoods are affected.\nWith their delivery capacity limited by a drop in revenues, cities need more help than ever before from the private sector and civil society.  In Indonesia, the private sector is providing rapid test kits at low cost to reduce the burden on the over stretched public health care system. In Bangladesh, civil society organizations are providing free shuttle services for health care workers. And in South Africa, a social enterprise purchases produce directly from small-scale farmers and matches them with nearby community organizations who distribute food or cooked meals to poor beneficiaries.\nCommunity ownership is especially important. In informal settlements in Indonesia, community-led initiatives for the production and distribution of masks, food and disinfectants, and monitoring of health conditions are supported through the national slum upgrading program KOTAKU. This helps strengthen the resilience of those living in deprivation and marginalization against the many challenges facing them.\nIn addition, cities need to give priority attention to marginalized groups during lockdown and distancing measures. This includes women subjected to increased incidence of gender-based violence or who are dispossessed of their land or property following the death of a male relative from COVID-19, older people isolated at home, children whose education and nutritional support are cut off, people living with disabilities, and groups who face discrimination.\nThe early recovery phase\nInformal sector workers with unstable jobs, irregular incomes and no safety nets need particular support in jumpstarting their livelihoods. Labor-intensive public works programs such as Kenya’s Kazi Mtaani are an important instrument. This program targets informal settlements in Nairobi and Mombasa and uses labor-intensive approaches to create employment opportunities for youth and affected informal sector workers. The first phase aims to create 26,000 employment opportunities in street cleaning, fumigation and disinfection, garbage collection, drainage clearing, and production and distribution of face masks.\nIn addition to the focus on the poor and vulnerable, jumpstarting cities’ economy is critical to give a boost to local businesses and especially small and micro-enterprises that are hard hit. Policies such as temporary property tax abatements, scaling up public works and targeted procurement are key to support local businesses, complementing stimulus packages by national governments.\nThe implementation of recovery plans requires city governments to coordinate with many stakeholders – sectoral agencies, the private sector, and community groups – to develop integrated measures and prioritize investments. Establishing a metropolitan coordination entity or mechanism will help facilitate collaboration among the many agencies delivering services and carrying out investments and resilience measures.\nThis pandemic provides three main lessons to national and city governments as they launch recovery efforts and plan for the new normal.\nNew normal phase\nAs they emerge from this pandemic, cities will need to strengthen their resilience by investing in better emergency preparedness and integrating public health risks into disaster management systems. Risk reduction measures include adapted zoning, land use, and territorial planning to regulate high-risk uses, including the location and hygienic operation of wet markets and abattoirs. Cities also need improved and more diverse finances to enable a stronger role in emergency response and recovery.\nMany questions and uncertainties need to be addressed as cities emerge from the pandemic:\nAnswering these questions will determine whether cities can better adapt and become more resilient. By applying a wide range of insights and innovations from technology, sociology, placemaking, urban planning and design, and policy making, we can help cities continue to play their indispensable role far into the future.\nThe World Bank’s City Resilient Program, UN-Habitat Urban Resilience Hub,  UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction’s Making Cities Resilient Campaign (and its successor MCR 2030 to be launched by the end of this year), and the Global Resilient Cities Network’s Cities for a Resilient Recovery Program are all important initiatives to strengthen cities’ resilience and disaster preparedness and to help shape the cities of the future through collaboration and knowledge exchange.\nFirst Published here: https://blogs.worldbank.org/sustainablecities/cities-are-front-lines-co…\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/cities-are-on-the-front-lines-of-covid-19", "abstract": "Across the globe, COVID-19 is threatening cities and communities, endangering not only public health..."},

UN-Habitat hired 66 field agents, mostly women, from the city’s 10 largest slums who visited over 100,000 households between August 2019 and February 2020 to carry out interviews.\nAs a result some 28,000 families were identified as being the most vulnerable and during the COVID-19, pandemic, they are being monitored, and supported. About 8,000 families have been visited by health workers and approximately 4,000 have been provided with social assistance. Almost 2,000 baskets of food and hygiene supplies were delivered to families with bedridden members, older persons, or those with severe respiratory problems. Since the pandemic, the team can no longer make field visits, but they have made around 4,000 phone calls to families in extreme poverty monitored by the programme.\nMeanwhile in the municipality of Maricá, State of Rio, the team has been providing fast, reliable information to support the city’s decision-making in responding to COVID-19.\nThrough its project Chegou a Sua Vez (“It’s Your Turn”) implemented with the city through the Darcy Ribeiro Institute, the team has identified older people with chronic diseases, small business owners, informal workers, and people with no access to basic income. A minimum wage has been paid to informal workers, and 31,000 basic food and hygiene baskets were distributed the families of students enrolled in the municipal public school system. This quality information and georeferenced data has helped local authorities identify those who might otherwise be left out of distribution channels.\nUN-Habitat is also supporting the Government of Alagoas, the second poorest state in Brazil, to draw up quick responses to the pandemic in the slums of Maceió, the state capital. Several datasets were analysed and submitted to the local government, including maps indicating which informal settlements lacked adequate water supply and are home to the largest percentage of people over 60 years old.\nUN-Habitat's Regional Representative for Latin America and the Caribbean, Elkin Velásquez said it was important that the data bases were a result of surveys and mappings managed by community members.\n“The data plays a key role in helping the municipalities target the delivery of humanitarian assistance during the COVID-19 crisis to really make sure it reaches the right people,” he said.\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/making-the-invisible-visible-%E2%80%93-working-with-communities-to-ensure-the-most-vulnerable-are-supported", "abstract": "Rio de Janeiro and Alagoa States, Brazil, May 2020 – Thousands of the poorest and most vulnerable pe..."},

Infectious diseases thrive in overcrowded cities, or where there is inadequate access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene facilities; living in unhealthy environments killed 12.6 million people in 2012 and air pollution killed 7 million people in 2016. However only 1 in 10 cities worldwide meet standards for healthy air,\n“If the purpose of urban planning is not for human health, then what is it for?” said Dr Maria Neira, WHO Director, Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health.  “Ideally, cities are planned for adequate standards of living and working, sustained economic growth, social development, environmental sustainability, better connectivity… but the ‘why’ at the core of all these things comes down to physical and mental health and wellbeing.”\n“Investments in health-based urban and territorial planning secure long-term health and wellbeing legacies for a growing proportion of humans,” said Dr Nathalie Roebbel, WHO Unit Head, Air Quality and Health.\nOver half the world’s population now lives in cities, and by 2050 that is expected to rise to a full 70 per cent of the human population. However, 75 per cent of the infrastructure that will be in place by then has not yet been built.\nThis presents an opportunity to build transformative urban areas, especially as the world begins to build back with a greater consciousness of the links between space and health.\nOne essential consideration is equity as there are substantial differences in health opportunities and outcomes within and across urban areas. The sourcebook is based on the premise that public health and urban planning both aim for fair and equitable outcomes and access to essential services.\n“Urban and territorial planning provides a framework to align and transform our built and natural environments. Putting human and environmental health back into the core of the urban and territorial planning process and principles will enable the full potential of our cities and territories to deliver healthier and resilient environments,” said Laura Petrella, UN-Habitat Chief of Planning, Finance and Economy.\nThe sourcebook offers a comprehensive variety of resources, including frameworks, entry points, guidance and tools, as well as specific case studies illustrating recommended approaches to bring together planning and public health.\nThe tools include a variety of health appraisal, analysis and data tools, such as   city-wide public space assessment, health impact assessment, cumulative risk and comparative risk assessments, spatial epidemiology, online analytical tools, citizen science, city dashboards and city profiling.\nThe sourcebook explains why health needs to be a part of urban and territorial planning and how to make it happen.\nIt also includes how to choose the best entry points for health — whether by setting, outcome, principle or sector — whatever the urban or territorial planning process, at any level.\n“Urban and territorial planning is a vehicle for health improvement and ultimately for achieving the New Urban Agenda and the many targets associated with urban health and the Sustainable Development Goals - applying a health ‘lens’ to this process ensures all the determinants of health are considered,” said  Shipra Narang Suri, Chief of UN-Habitat’s Urban Practices Branch.\nRead: Key messages Integrating Health in Urban and Territorial Planning: A Source book\nRead in: Spanish\nRead in: Portuguese\n", "_url": "https://unhabitat.org/urban-planning-crucial-for-better-public-health-in-cities", "abstract": "New WHO and UN-HABITAT sourcebook guides health and planning practitioners on putting health at the ..."},
