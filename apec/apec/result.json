Ministers recognized that the risk of this pandemic is far greater for women and vulnerable groups and urged economies to focus efforts on building resilience to be better prepared to respond to future pandemics and other shocks. \n“We need to have a sustainability mindset where we meet food security demands without compromising the well-being and ability of the future generation to fulfil their needs, as well as safeguarding natural resources,” he explained. He added that members need to address disruptions to employment and income sources. \nThe growing adoption of technology in the agriculture sector such as smart farming and biotechnology can enhance food security by increasing efficiency and productivity, bridging production and consumers’ demands, and minimizing food loss and waste. Members are encouraged to invest in training and capacity building to equip farmers and producers with necessary digital skills. \nMinisters endorsed a joint statement, highlighting their commitment to bolster food security resiliency and efforts to prevent future pandemics. \nTo read the 2020 Ministerial Policy Dialogue on Food Security Statement on COVID-19 visit this page \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

Open and non-discriminatory markets will ensure that goods and services can reach those in most urgent need”, she continued. Likewise, continued investment in the region will be important to countering the economic fallout from the pandemic. \n“We must intensify efforts to enhance the financial inclusion of MSMEs and their participation in international trade through a more robust enabling environment and capacity building for digital transformation”, Dato Rohana noted. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of a robust digital connectivity to promote economic participation and drive inclusive growth. APEC economies should foster the development of more secure, accessible and affordable digital infrastructure for all and of free and secure flows of data across borders. \nThere should also be a commitment to sharing research findings and vaccine solutions on a free and open basis. \nTrade needs to play a central role in economic recovery. “Now more than ever, we need to stay the course on trade and investment liberalization and not regress from free trade”, Dato Rohana stated. “We need to constantly remind ourselves that the pursuit of open markets in the region has lifted millions of people out of poverty and not turn our back on globalization.” \nAPEC economies must work collaboratively to plan for the re-opening of borders. ABAC proposes the establishment of a temporary APEC coordination body as soon as possible to provide guidance for the orderly re-opening of borders and development of quarantine protocols. This body would collaborate, share information and evaluate available data against agreed criteria, that would enable all APECeconomies to assess when and how to open borders and fully reconnect with other economies as safely as possible. \nThe full text of the ABAC COVID-19 Report may be viewed at: \nhttp://www2.abaconline.org/assets/ABAC_COVID-19_Report.pdf \nFor further information please contact: \nMr. Syazwan Zainal, ABAC Malaysia Centre, Tel: +60 12 261 9959, Email: [email protected] Mr. Antonio Basilio, Director, ABAC Secretariat, Tel: (63 2) 8845 4564, Email: [email protected] \n"},

Women may also be at greater risk or exposure due to occupational sex-segregation—according to a United Nations’ policy brief , women make up 70 percent of the health workforce and are more likely to be frontline health workers, especially as nurses, midwives and community health workers. \nDatuk Seri Rina highlighted the importance of APEC not only as a policy forum, but as a platform to advance regional joint actions towards providing equal access to resources and opportunities for women and girls to benefit from and contribute to redeveloping our economy. \n“It is critical for APEC economies to adjust our policies urgently to support, empower and effectively address the varying degrees of multidimensional and damaging impacts on women and girls in the region during this pandemic,” she added. \nRecognizing that more effort is needed, especially in the area of women’s participation in the digital economy, leadership and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), Datuk Seri Rina urged member economies to intensify public partnerships and engagement with the private sector. She stressed the role of the La Serena Roadmap on Women and Inclusive Growth as an important guide for members for achieving the women’s empowerment agenda. \nEndorsed in Chile, last year, the roadmap seeks to encourage actions in several cross -cutting areas affecting economic growth for women. This includes access to capital and markets, labor force participation, access to leadership positions, education, training and skills development. The roadmap also encourages promoting more access for women in the context of a constantly changing world of work, as well as advancing sex-disaggregated data collection and analysis. \n“Women workers and women-led small businesses continue to bear the brunt of the negative side effects of travel restrictions, lockdowns and social distancing regimes because women are in consumer-facing services sectors,” explained APEC Secretariat Executive Director, Dr Rebecca Sta Maria in her remarks at the forum. “It is in this context that APEC’s continued leadership is necessary. We need to focus on not just the challenges but also on the role that women are playing in dealing with the pandemic, their contributions and their role in the recovery.” \nDr Sta Maria underlined the significance of trade in promoting gender equality and the need for member economies to focus on inclusive trade and investment policies so that “the policies facilitate unlocking otherwise untapped potential of women and girls in the region.” \nGender and economic development ministers and senior officials agreed on a joint statement at the meeting, reflecting their views to advancing women’s economic empowerment to strengthen post-pandemic economic recovery and resilience. \nRead the APEC Women and the Economy Forum Statement \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

He reinforced that the task will involve close participation not only between APEC economies, but with different sectors, such as the private sector. \nThis is the second virtual gathering of APEC senior officials this year, and is part of a cluster of virtual engagements among APEC groups and committees that are responsible for different sectors, such as disaster response and trade and investment. Each of these groups are exploring solutions in response to the pandemic from different angles. \n“The innovative and dynamic nature of the Asia-Pacific business community will be crucial in laying the groundwork for the region’s economic recovery and resilience,” he said. “The recommendations of this sector, as represented by the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) , will be relevant additions to the recommendations we will be presenting to our ministers.” \nReporting on the recommendation of the business sector, the 2020 Chair ABAC, Dato’ Rohana Mahmood, reiterates the importance of keeping markets, goods, services and investment open. “A global pandemic requires a coordinated global response,” she noted. “In a deeply integrated and interconnected world, it does not make sense for any economy to seek to be self-sufficient in the essential tools to fight the pandemic.” \n“At this point during the crisis, multilateral coordination is more crucial than ever,” said Dr Rebecca Sta Maria , Executive Director of the APEC Secretariat. “We are entering a period when decisions are to be made that will affect how economies will engage with each other to face challenges not only in the months ahead, but for years to come.” \nHairil noted that everything APEC will do from this point on will be framed by the COVID-19 crisis. But he added that many of the agendas and priorities the forum has been pursuing for the past few years leading to 2020 seem to have only gotten more relevant, such as adapting to digital technologies while ensuring economies are people-centered. \n“We have been shown why it is so important to ensure that our economies have the ability to cushion even the poorest citizens and smallest businesses from economic fallout,” said Hairil. “The continuation of trade and cooperation can be a matter of survival as well as a means to achieving shared prosperity.” \nAPEC’s Ministers Responsible for Trade will hold a virtual meeting on Saturday, 25 July 2020, to follow up on recommendations and work plans submitted by senior officials and ABAC. \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

It identifies the economic issues affecting food security and puts forward policy recommendations to strengthen regional food security. \nThe report notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions to the production of several food products, particularly those that require intensive use of labour, such as meat processing facilities and fruit and vegetable packing plants. Outbreaks among food production workers and the unavailability of temporary migrant workers could impact the economy’s ability to produce food. \n“Member economies need to ensure that reductions in production capacity do not occur in multiple food sectors at the same time, which could potentially cause a breakdown in the overall domestic and international food supply chain,” explained Carlos Kuriyama, Senior Analyst with the APEC Policy Support Unit . \nMost food products are shipped by sea. Although most of the major seaports in the region have remained open and shipping lines have continued to operate the analysis shows that there have been substantial delays in shipping times for sea freight due to reduced container capacity as well as stringent border measures to reduce the spread of the virus. \nTo tackle distribution bottlenecks, the report recommends that APEC member economies establish clear guidelines at ports of entry concerning the mobility of shipping crews and other transport workers, as well as expediting customs clearance. Policymakers are also encouraged to accelerate wider applications of digital technology at the border. \nAccelerating the adoption of digital tools will also help address the notable shift in consumer patterns of food products. For example, many restaurants have been forced to close. But others are offering delivery service to bring food directly to customers through digital platforms. The report highlights the case of small-scale farmers and fishermen in the region who have taken a similar approach and turned to e-commerce and mobile money for the first time in order to connect with buyers and suppliers. \nThe report further recommends APEC economies to consider food trade as an essential component of food security and to avoid protectionist measures such as export restrictions and policies which are not based on evidence and scientific risk assessment. \nSenior agriculture and food industry officials as well as private sector representatives will convene virtually later this week to further discuss strategic measures to address the challenges caused by the COVID-19 crisis and improve resiliency in food systems. Following the meeting, agriculture and food ministers and senior representatives will also meet virtually at the Ministerial Policy Dialogue on Food Security on 27 October, chaired by Malaysia’s Minister of Agriculture and Food Industries, Datuk Seri Dr Ronald Kiandee. \nFor more information on the “Food Security Response Measures to COVID-19” Policy Brief by APEC Policy Support Unit, visit this page . \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

However, it is also preventable with effective vaccination and secondary prevention approaches, including screening. Early detection and management is key to successful cervical cancer treatment. \n“APEC economies face challenges in availability, accessibility and affordability to cervical cancer screening, disproportionately affecting low-income women at high risk,” explained Dr Fanghui Zhao, Director of the Department of Cancer Epidemiology, National Cancer Center and Cancer Hospital with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the author of the winning study. \n“Cervical cancer remains one of the gravest avoidable medical threats to women’s lives,” she added. “Developing and validating affordable and easy-to-access technologies and strategies are the key solution. By applying effective preventative methods, no woman should die from cervical cancer.” \nDr Zhao was announced the winner during the virtual High Level Policy Dialogue on Women and the Economy meeting on Wednesday by Malaysia’s Minister of Women, Family and Community Development, Datuk Seri Rina Harun. APEC gender and economic development ministers, senior officials, as well as thought leaders and experts have recognized the differing socioeconomic impact of the pandemic at the meeting and committed to put women and girls at the center of economic recovery efforts . \n“COVID-19 has demonstrated the importance of caregiving and the disproportionate role that women play in providing it. It is incumbent upon policymakers to identify data-backed policies that alleviate the double burden women currently face, because we all benefit when women participate in the economy,” said Minister Datuk Seri Rina Harun. \nLaunched in Chile last year, the APEC Healthy Women, Healthy Economies Research Prize awards USD 20,000 to the winner and USD 2,000 each to two runners-up. In partnership with Merck, the prize recognizes of the winners’ work which enables policymakers and business leaders to identify and implement measures to improve women’s health in APEC economies so women can join and rise in the workforce. \n“In times of uncertainty, data is particularly crucial to ensure that policymakers and business leaders are able to make informed decisions. The collection, collation, and proliferation of sex-disaggregated data and research is vital to ensure that women are not left behind in the recovery from COVID-19,” said Liz Henderson, Regional Vice President, Asia Pacific, Merck Healthcare. “Better health and economic outcomes for women will improve not only gender parity, but also the overall economic environment.” \nDr Lih Rong Wang of Chinese Taipei and Dr Dorothy Chan of Hong Kong, China were the runners up for this year’s prize. Dr Wang’s research explored the positive impact of family-oriented work policies like flexible work schedules and paid parental leave. Dr. Chan’s research studied how the efficacy of health programs can be improved by involving stakeholders who can incorporate cultural and socio-environmental components in future interventions. \nThe Healthy Women, Healthy Economies initiative aims to improve women’s health and economic empowerment through public-private partnerships. Released in 2015, the Healthy Women, Healthy Economies Policy Toolkit highlights five areas for improving women’s health across five areas: workplace health and safety; health awareness and access; sexual and reproductive health; gender-based violence; and work/life balance. \nFor more information on the work of the finalists and on applying for the 2021 prize, please visit the APEC Healthy Women Healthy Economies website . \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

This has improved the business climate and increased economic opportunities,” explained Dr James Ding, Chair of the APEC Economic Committee. “The pandemic has pushed policymakers around the region to further speed up this effort to support the economic recovery and make it easier for people and businesses to get back on their feet.” \nThe APEC region’s economic growth is now expected to decline by 3.7 percent in 2020, bringing the total output loss to a staggering USD 2.9 trillion. Member economies have been quick to roll out significant and targeted fiscal measures ranging from 1 percent to 20 percent of gross domestic product to address the impact of COVID-19. Despite this unprecedented stimulus in response to economic losses, the crisis persists. \n“With more businesses facing the threat of permanent closure, unemployment numbers rising and health risks still high, we need to quickly improve our current policies and regulations, especially those related to healthcare systems, social protection, the ease of doing business and inclusive growth,” Dr Ding added. \nAdvancing the digital economy to empower businesses and communities in these difficult times has been the focus across the region. In a virtual meeting last week, experts shared how they are facilitating work in the digital economy, including by addressing issues around competition infringement and competition law, and strengthening economic and legal infrastructure and regulatory reform. \n“In the past few months, we have experienced the importance of connectivity and now fully appreciate why it is so critical for a successful digital economy. We need to ensure that when we advance the digital economy agenda, we also build capacity, infrastructure and narrow the digital divide,” said Dr Rebecca Sta Maria, Executive Director of the APEC Secretariat. “This way, we can encourage the inclusive participation of all members of the society in our economy, including those who are vulnerable.” \nMembers also reviewed what progress has been made toward promoting more open, well-functioning transparent and competitive markets and deepening participation by all segments of society and sustainable social policies. \n“This pandemic has presented an opportunity to develop a long-term reform agenda that will improve members’ resiliency towards any emergencies in the future,” Dr Ding concluded. \nUnder the Renewed APEC Agenda for Structural Reform mandate, member economies have been working toward a robust, comprehensive and ambitious agenda to reduce inequality and stimulate growth since 2015.

Fundamentally trade can and must be at the centre of tackling both the immediate crisis and of laying the groundwork for a return to growth. The WTO is core to that effort,” said ABAC Chair Dato’ Rohana Tan Sri Mahmood of Malaysia. \nDato Rohana explained that ABAC had issued a statement of support for a reformed WTO ahead of the meeting of APEC Ministers Responsible for Trade (MRT) taking place on 25 July. She said that ABAC had been deeply concerned at the levels of human suffering and severe economic contraction caused by the pandemic. \n“Our message to Ministers is that global problems demand global solutions – and the WTO’s multilateral rules-based system must be at the heart of those solutions,” said Dato Rohana. “We are calling on APEC economies to lead a process of reform in the WTO to ensure that trade rules remain fit-for-purpose.” \nShe said that we need to liberalise trade in essential medical supplies and facilitate the movement of essential workers, so that for this and any future pandemics, those critical products and services can get to where they are needed most. Likewise, APEC economies should reaffirm their commitment to well- functioning agriculture markets, so that we do not add a food security crisis to the disruption of the pandemic. \n“We also need to ensure that the WTO’s rules remain relevant and credible. It is imperative that we get the WTO’s dispute settlement system fully functioning again by appointing new members to the Appellate Body. We need more transparency around what economies are doing on trade. We must complete the unfinished business of the Doha Round, including by eliminating fisheries subsidies, making meaningful cuts to trade-distorting domestic support in agriculture and helping services and investment to work better,” she added. \nDato Rohana said that just as importantly, the WTO needed to stay responsive to modern business and social concerns. There is a need to review the rules in other areas to ensure that they are doing the job. The rules must also be updated for the digital age and support aspirations for sustainable and inclusive growth. That means substantive outcomes on e-commerce and a permanent moratorium on Customs duties on electronic transmission, tools to transition to a low-carbon economy by eliminating inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, and better ways for women and small businesses to succeed in trade. \nThe APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) is deeply concerned about the fundamental challenge to global wellbeing represented by COVID-19. We face a “crisis like no other”. The multilateral rules-based trading system, with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at its core, has a key role to play in our response in both the short term to the pandemic and for longer-term economic rebuilding. ABAC urges APEC economies to lead work in the WTO both to enhance short-term responses, and for the longer-term strengthening of the multilateral rules-based trading system. \nA strong commitment to a credible, relevant and strengthened WTO that reflects evolving business needs and models is crucial to help rebuild business and investor confidence and to improve the trade landscape in the age of COVID-19. \nAPEC economies should thus reaffirm their support for urgent reform of the WTO in the strongest terms. The process to appoint a new Director General must not be allowed to distract from the following critical tasks, but rather must contribute to achieving them: \n1. Drawing on the lessons of COVID-19, reform WTO rules for better responses to crises \nWTO rules for trade in goods and services can enable essential medical supplies, essential workers and food supplies to get to where they are needed most. APEC economies should lead an initiative in the WTO to enable economies to respond more effectively to crises, including by: \n2. Work to strengthen the multilateral rules-based trading system \nThe WTO provides a crucial foundation for sustained prosperity. The Great Depression of the 1930s and the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 have shown that declining trade, worsened by protectionism, exacerbates the depth and duration of economic contraction. On the other hand, trade based on WTO principles of openness, non-discrimination, predictability and transparency can help to revitalise growth for the longer term, including for the most vulnerable. \ni. Resolve the unfinished business from the Doha Round \nMeaningful improvements are needed to the existing framework of rules, commitments and obligations to revitalise trade and achieve more sustainable and inclusive growth. APEC economies should take the lead in pressing for concrete outcomes, including on the following items of ‘unfinished business’ from the Doha Round: \nii. Fully functioning dispute settlement is fundamental to the multilateral trading system \nThe WTO dispute settlement system has resolved over 400 disputes, and forestalled many more. Every economy will be worse off if this system cannot operate to its fullest extent. APEC economies should: \nrecognising that some economies have joined the Multi-Party Interim Appeal Arbitration Arrangement as a temporary option to settle appeals. \niii. Initiatives to reflect the evolution of trade will revitalise the multilateral trading system \nWTO rules must better reflect modern business and societal concerns. APEC economies should: \nAPEC economies should ensure that all of these outcomes are consistent with WTO principles and are designed with a view to serving as building blocks to multilateral outcomes in the future. Global challenges demand global solutions. The APEC Business Advisory Council and the wider Asia-Pacific business community fully supports APEC’s leadership in this most critical area. \nFor further information please contact: \nMr. Syazwan Zainal, ABAC Malaysia Centre, Tel: +60 12 261 9959, Email: [email protected] Mr. Antonio Basilio, Director, ABAC Secretariat, Tel: (63 2) 8845 4564, Email: [email protected] \n"},

This is compounded by an additional 23 million people becoming unemployed in 2020. \n“The APEC region is on the frontlines for meeting this challenge because member economies are among the first and worst affected by the pandemic,” said APEC Secretariat Executive Director, Dr Rebecca Sta Maria. “A crisis of unprecedented severity calls for a response of unprecedented scale.” \nThe policy brief projects an economic rebound in 2021, with the APEC region anticipated to grow by 6.3 percent, higher than the projected global economic growth of 5.8 percent. \n“As hopeful as it looks, the rebound is conditional on the effectiveness of members’ containment mechanisms to avoid a further wave of the pandemic later this year,” said APEC Policy Support Unit Director, Denis Hew. \nThe unprecedented shock to the global economy requires a well-targeted and coordinated regional response towards socioeconomic recovery, including greater support for healthcare systems and increased social protection. \nThe APEC region has an average of 4.1 hospital beds, 1.9 physicians, and 3.9 nurses or midwives per 1,000 people. While these figures have improved since the SARS outbreak in 2003, the current capacity of health systems is insufficient considering significantly higher infection rates and the uncertainty of the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nAll 21 APEC member economies are rolling out significant and targeted fiscal measures ranging from 1 percent to 20 percent of gross domestic product to address the impact of COVID-19, including assistance for the unemployed and small and medium-sized enterprises. \n“ Member economies quickly rose to the challenge by introducing fiscal and monetary measures,” said Sta Maria. “The focus now is for members to come together for coordinated multilateral cooperation to support our people and small businesses.” \n“Only by working together will we be better equipped to weather this pandemic and fast track our recovery.” \nRegional and international organizations such as APEC have a key role to play in ensuring that members continue to exchange relevant public health information including updates on containment measures, and the development of testing kits, treatments and vaccines. Regional cooperation can likewise contribute to improving healthcare access and capacity among member economies. \nThe policy brief also recommends that APEC members should work to ensure an uninterrupted supply of medical goods and food. This includes eliminating trade-restrictive measures on essential goods to help with the response to the crisis and eventual recovery. \nDownload the policy brief, APEC in the Epicentre of COVID-19 \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

She added that “Complementing this effort, economies should facilitate trade in these critical supplies by simplifying and expediting border procedures, and should relax the rules to allow essential workers, including medical professionals to move across borders to serve the areas of greatest need.” \n“Underpinning all of this, APEC economies should of course share their experiences in acting to contain the pandemic, exchange data and research, and collaborate on public health measures,” added Dato Rohana. \nDato Rohana cautioned that actions needed to go beyond addressing health. “This is rapidly becoming a financial and economic crisis too,” she noted. “The impacts on workers, businesses and supply chains are already severe. We are especially concerned about small businesses, the self-employed and those in the informal economy, who are ill-equipped to withstand these impacts,” said Dato Rohana. “We call on Ministers to share ideas and collaborate on approaches to address the rapid rise in unemployment, bankruptcies and other business challenges around liquidity, credit and tax payments.” \nDato Rohana said that, looking to the longer term, any eventual recovery would take longer if the engines of trade and investment could not be re-started quickly. “We urge APEC economies to announce a standstill on all new trade-restrictive measures for the rest of this year and to agree concrete actions to reduce protectionism going forward,” said Dato Rohana. “Our most vulnerable communities need to be able to access food and other essential household products. Our businesses need to have the confidence to re-invest and rebuild our economies. Protectionism of any sort impedes the road to recovery,” the Chair added. \nUnderpinning all these efforts, ABAC called on APEC economies to make the fullest possible use of digital technologies and connectivity, to collaborate effectively across economies and enable a level of economic activity to continue. “Access to resilient digital infrastructure such as broadband, including in emerging economies, is essential. So is minimizing barriers to cross border data flows,” Dato Rohana added. \n“There is no precedent for the global shut down we are now experiencing and no guidebook to assist us as we recover” said Dato Rohana, “so it is critical that APEC economies work collaboratively to address the immediate challenges and to plan for reopening of our borders as soon as possible.” \nAPEC Member Economies: Australia; Brunei Darussalam; Canada; Chile; China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan; Korea; Malaysia; Mexico; New Zealand; Papua New Guinea; Peru; Philippines; Russia; Singapore; Chinese Taipei; Thailand; United States of America; and Viet Nam. \nABAC was created by APEC Leaders in 1995 to be the primary voice of business in APEC.

Moving forward, this will no longer be the case. \n“It will take a long time before people have the confidence and trust in traveling again. Even when the situation gets better, it will take a while for global travel to pick up the pace,” said Dr Rebecca Sta Maria, the APEC Secretariat’s Executive Director, in her remarks to officials. \n“The tourism industry is the backbone for many of our small businesses, women and vulnerable communities,” she continued. “We must fine tune our approach to provide the people in our communities the support they need in navigating through these difficult times.” \nThe travel and tourism sector employs 57.5 million people in the APEC region and contributes USD1.5 trillion to global domestic product (GDP). There are 470 international airports in APEC economies, facilitating business and leisure travel. The scale of the industry’s contribution to the economy makes it an important driver of growth for the region. \nWork in promoting sustainable and inclusive tourism within APEC is underway, including aligning policies among member economies, facilitating travel and improving coordination mechanisms. Given current developments, the group is reviewing the existing work plans and goals, including exploring the best solutions to conform to the new normal within the tourism industry. \nThe group will also bolster efforts in strengthening the resiliency of tourism by incorporating risk and emergency management measures, enhancing information flow for sharing best practices and encouraging more collaboration. \n“Members are keen to open up the economy and revive the tourism sector, however the health and safety of travelers are paramount. We need to work closely with our health and emergency preparedness agencies in developing standard procedures that will instill confidence, encourage travel and ensure safety at the same time,” Daud concluded. \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

The severity and uncertainty as to the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic further aggravate the ongoing challenges,\" said Dr Denis Hew, Director of the APEC Policy Support Unit . \nAccording to the latest APEC Regional Trends Analysis, the Asia-Pacific recorded weaker economic growth at 3.6 percent in 2019, compared to 4.2 percent in 2018. \nWith the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic beginning earlier this year, a gloomier outlook is predicted for APEC in 2020. The region's economic growth is expected to post a record decline of 2.7 percent in 2020, which is contingent on the effective containment of the virus and the implementation of economic measures. \nThe report, first delivered to the Virtual Extraordinary Senior Officials' Meeting on Wednesday, shows a substantial decline in merchandise trade volume and value in the APEC region due to the implementation of various trade-restrictive measures such as anti-dumping, tariffs, duties and other levies. \nGrowth in the volume of merchandise exports dropped significantly to 0.6 percent in 2019, compared to 4.3 percent in 2018, while the volume of merchandise imports turned negative in 2019 after a 4.9 percent expansion in 2018. \nSimilarly, the value of APEC's merchandise exports and imports contracted by 1.9 percent and 2.9 percent in 2019, respectively. \nContrary to the merchandise trade numbers, the region's trade in services remained positive in 2019, albeit at lower levels than in 2018. The trade in services’ global growth is attributed to the increasing demand for digital technology services and automated services solutions, among others. \n\"Closer ties and cooperation between members are vital for ensuring the availability of credible and updated information to help policymakers around the region to develop appropriate policy responses at an exceptional scale,\" said Dr Rebecca Sta Maria, APEC Secretariat's Executive Director. \nFiscal and monetary support to mitigate the economic impact of containment measures, as well as stimulus packages are some of the key policy maneuvers that can be used for the uphill battle towards recovery. \n\"APEC, as an economic and trade forum, will soon have a new vision to guide its work for the next decades. This post-2020 vision will become more critical than ever as we navigate through the new normal and recalibrate our priorities for the future,\" Hew added. \n“Resiliency, sustainability and inclusivity will take center stage,” he continued. \"Support for healthcare systems and emergency preparedness will also be in the spotlight in our discussions.\" \nAPEC member economies should take advantage of the forum's open and voluntary environment to commence the work towards coordinated policy responses, according to the report. \nThese policy responses can ensure the free flow of medical goods and food supplies, improved access to and capacity of health systems, support for business and trade activities and a decisive move towards digitalization to catalyze economic activities in the region. \nView the latest APEC Regional Trends Analysis, May 2020 \nSee the Regional Economic Trends, May 2020 infographic \nSee the Pivoting to a Circular Economy infographic \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

The unintended impact of this scenario would be the risk of certain jobs being eliminated, which would contribute to creating further spikes in unemployment rates around the region. \nThe report calls on APEC policymakers to conduct a thorough risk assessment of jobs that may be impacted or eliminated by automation to understand the challenges faced by workers and the unforeseen impacts of crisis-response policies. \n“It is impossible for us to talk about growth when people are struggling to secure their livelihoods,” Dr Rebecca Fatima Sta Maria, Executive Director of the APEC Secretariat commented. “We have been mandated by ministers to prioritize the return of workers to employment.

The APEC region’s economic growth is now expected to decline by 3.7 percent in 2020, down from its initial forecast of a 2.7 percent contraction in April , bringing the total output loss to a staggering USD 2.9 trillion. \nThese new projections are in line with the revisions by the International Monetary Fund in its recently updated World Economic Outlook . Global growth is projected to fall to - 4.9 percent, compared to a decline of -3 percent estimated earlier by the IMF. \n“The protracted duration of the pandemic has caused worse than anticipated impacts on the global economy, with some economies recently reporting a second wave of infection cases” said Dr Denis Hew, Director of the APEC Policy Support Unit. \nDr Hew added that economic recovery is in the horizon but it is “highly dependent on the availability of vaccines and treatments as well as the effectiveness of economic policies that are being implemented by economies to address the pandemic”. \nThe updated report projects an economic recovery for the region of 5.7 percent in 2021, compared to the earlier estimate of 6.3 percent. This economic rebound hinges on whether the pandemic can be contained over the second half of this year. \nThe APEC region’s growth declined by 2.2 percent in the first quarter of this year due to travel restrictions and widespread lockdown measures that depressed domestic consumption, trade and investment activities. \nMerchandise trade recorded a bigger contraction in the first quarter from the combined impact of trade tensions and supply chain disruptions. “In overall terms, merchandise trade in APEC has significantly decreased in both value and volume this year,” explained Rhea C. Hernando, APEC Policy Unit’s researcher who wrote the updated report. “The temporary restrictions imposed on food and medical supplies weakened trade even further in the first quarter of the year.” \nThe region’s value of trade in goods dropped by 5.8 percent for exports and 4.1 percent for imports. \nForeign direct investment shares similar sentiment with inflows to the APEC region going down by 3.1 percent, while greenfield investments dropped sharply by 20.4 percent in 2019. \nIn the midst of uncertainties, the report recommends APEC economies to take decisive actions including intensifying efforts towards containment measures to avoid further waves of the pandemic, while at the same time maintaining fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to help alleviate the risk of people falling into poverty and businesses going bankrupt. \nThe report also urged member economies to invest in digital technology, including building or boosting technological infrastructure, equipping workers with digital skills and modernizing business and governance processes. This investment could contribute to making economies more innovative and dynamic while expanding access and opportunities to everyone. \nFor more information on the July 2020 Update of the APEC Regional Trends Analysis “Deeper contraction calls for decisive action” policy brief by APEC Policy Support Unit, visit this page. \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

These firms contribute between 40 to 60 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP) in most economies and employ around 60 percent of all workers across the 21 members. There are nearly 150 million businesses considered to be small businesses in the region. \nThe report finds that promoting the adoption of digital tools and solutions will help small businesses tap new revenue streams, reduce costs and eliminate pain points during the COVID-19 crisis, particularly around managing transactions at a distance, delivering goods efficiently and engaging with consumers. \nDespite the benefits, it is crucial to recognize that digital solutions are not a panacea and have their own set of challenges, including cybersecurity and data privacy concerns, exposure to digital fraud, misinformation and digital divide and infrastructure issues. \n“Governments across APEC are providing relief measures for small businesses including payment deadline delays, rate cuts, income tax exemptions, wage subsidies, soft loans and refinancing,” explained APEC Policy Support Unit Analyst, Andre Wirjo, who co-authored the policy brief. “Policymakers should proactively adopt a two-pronged approach for allowing small businesses to reap the benefits while overcoming the challenges of going digital.” \nThe report highlights policy recommendations that policymakers can consider in their effort to accelerate benefits for small businesses in going digital, particularly those in the food and beverages sector as well as retail and wholesale sector.

Members highlighted the need to boost supply chains’ resiliency and connectivity by focusing on harmonization and modernization of custom procedures,  increasing the use of digital technologies and enhanced cross-border connectivity. \nTrade facilitation is seen as one of the main instruments to accelerate recovery. Members pressed for the need to encourage and deepen the implementation rate of the World Trade Organization’s Trade Facilitation Agreement (WTO TFA). According to the APEC Policy Support Unit, wider implementation of the WTO TFA could result in an eight to 15 percent reduction of trade costs . \n“It is clear that members expressed commitment to keep markets open and to avoid restrictive measures that can disrupt the trade of essentials good,” she explained. “Members also further explored ways to facilitate the trade of medical goods and other essential goods.” \nMembers also highlighted the urgency to enhance efforts in building, facilitating and promoting the capacity of micro, small and medium enterprises to integrate and participate in international trade through digital trade and inclusive policies. Further work on the development of the internet and digital economy will be undertaken by APEC’s recently established Digital Economy Steering Group . \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has restricted the movement of people in the region and further hinders the support for trade and investment activities. Members exchanged views on the importance of facilitating business travel and allowing some flexibility to continue commercial activities. \nBobenrieth believes that the committee can play a leading role in implementing the tasks mandated by APEC Ministers’ Responsible for Trade in their COVID-19 statement. \n“Trade and investment are key components for economic growth and I am very encouraged by the constructive discussions and valuable exchange of ideas from member economies in this novel format,” she stated, adding that the committee currently has over 40 initiatives in its pipeline that can contribute to solve the current challenges. \nPolicy monitoring and information sharing mechanism are critical aspects for assisting policymakers across the region to develop sound policies.

We express our sincere condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives in this epidemic. We reaffirm the central importance of collaboration at all levels to combat this infectious disease and commit to working together to bring this epidemic under control as fast as possible. Lessons learned from past epidemics like SARS, 2009 H1N1 and Ebola have strengthened and improved the resiliency of the global public health system. These improvements in global health security are credit to the efforts of many people, including those in the health ministries and public health infrastructures of APEC economies. \nWe, the  APEC Health Working Group, recognize the major efforts and actions undertaken by all affected APEC economies to control the spread of COVID-19, in parallel with continual efforts to learn more about the virus, and defeat this common enemy. This entails working in close collaboration with all stakeholders and public health officials both across the APEC region and worldwide, noting the trans-boundary nature of disease. We appreciate all member economies’ efforts on transparency and recognize the importance of the role played by all APEC member economies to share information to increase the likelihood of success of collaborative efforts to fight the epidemic. The APEC Health Working Group also stresses the importance of working with established mechanisms, such as the World Health Organization’s International Health Regulations (2005), which play a key role in supporting the global response. \nWe, the APEC Health Working Group, also acknowledge that the current epidemic is having other effects on APEC economies, including travel and trade. Major threats to health security can impose an extra burden on health systems and increase costs. Therefore and in line with the HWG’s recent efforts to strengthen our policy-focus and contributions on issues of health and the economy, the APEC Health Working Group sees merit in exchanging views on the public health implications of efforts to respond and control this outbreak using an economic lens. These efforts will be in harmony with the work of other international fora and allow the APEC Health Working Group to amplify regional perspectives without duplicating work done elsewhere. In particular, the APEC Health Working Group will consider best practices that were utilized by APEC member economies during the COVID-19 epidemic to support the health needs of APEC member populations, with this knowledge-exchange aiming to promote resilient health systems and further strengthen rapid emergency response capacities in the APEC region. This work is closely aligned with existing APEC Health Working Group work streams and the APEC Health Working Group will review and discuss at its meeting in August 2020 during the 3 rd Senior Officials’ Meeting. At that time, the APEC Health Working Group can consider \nadvice and recommendations it may wish to advance to APEC Ministers and Leaders. The APEC Health Working Group will also consider how the Group’s efforts can encourage economies to take action to further enhance the resilience, scalability and sustainability of health systems to promote healthy economies and people. \n"},
{"organization": "Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation", "category": "", "crawlTime": "2020-10-29", "title": "APEC Life Sciences Innovation Forum Statement on COVID-19", "issueAgency": "APEC", "issueTime": "12 June 2020", "abstract": "Policy environments that foster the growth of life sciences innovation are critical for controlling the pandemic and help us prepare for the next one.", "url": "https://www.apec.org/Press/News-Releases/2020/0612_lsif", "detail": "Key Messages \nThe members of the APEC Life Sciences Innovation Forum (LSIF) express our condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives to COVID-19 and express our sympathy to those who have seen their livelihoods affected by the economic fallout of this pandemic. We also express our support and appreciation for the health workers, scientists, and other personnel on the front lines for their contribution and sacrifice in protecting public health. \nThe APEC LSIF, established by APEC Economic Leaders in 2002, is APEC's leading initiative on health sciences innovation. It is a tripartite forum that engages representatives from government, industry and academia to foster an enabling policy environment for innovation in the medical life sciences sector. We are committed to supporting APEC economies with: enabling life sciences innovation; promoting resilient trade in medical products; ensuring the safety and quality of the medical products; accelerating regulatory convergence; facilitating innovative healthcare financing; and harnessing the digital economy and digital technology to enable the future of life sciences innovation. The LSIF reaffirms its commitments to fostering life science innovation cooperation in support of health for all and the shared prosperity of the Asia-Pacific community. \nAs APEC Economic Leaders have stated, “investing in health will benefit economic growth, worker performance and productivity, and poverty alleviation”. Our success in working together – as public officials, private sector research and manufacturing representatives, and academic representatives -- to develop diagnostics and to begin to treat patients with existing medicines while conducting trials with new medicines has been supported by the connections we have developed in APEC since we began to work together on other health challenges, and by the public-private-academic cooperation that APEC has fostered for almost two decades. The LSIF recognizes that addressing the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic requires coordination and a collective response in the spirit of solidarity and partnership. During the COVID-19 crisis, the LSIF remains steadfast in our commitment to continue to foster these partnerships between government, industry, and academia aimed at enhancing the development of and access to life sciences innovations.  Now more than ever it is imperative to collaborate on the design of clinical trials to ensure each participant’s experience results in regulatory grade data, and that we work together to enable and facilitate the availability of existing and novel vaccines and treatments that could safely be used to save and improve lives. We are also determined to contribute to APEC economies’ efforts in stimulating economic recovery and preparing for future pandemics. \nEnabling Life Sciences Innovation \nAPEC members recognize that trade, investment, and innovation policies play a vital role in enabling the life sciences industry to make bold investments in the research and development of new products, including those to treat and prevent COVID-19. Such policies have enabled the unprecedented number of collaborations currently underway between government, industry, and academia across the APEC region and around the world, and have allowed clinical trials for potential treatments and vaccines to start in record time following the initial sequencing of the viral genome that causes COVID-19. Most of the clinical trials underway for potential COVID-19 treatment and vaccine candidates are currently taking place in the APEC region. Ongoing collaboration will ensure these trials produce the type of information our regulators need to ensure the safety, quality and efficacy of diagnostics, medicines and treatments entering the market. \nPolicy environments that foster the growth of life sciences innovation are critical for not only controlling this pandemic but also preparing for future ones. The LSIF recognizes the importance of flexible approaches and innovative public-private partnerships during global public health emergencies, but also cautions that changing innovation-enabling policies could undermine the development of safe and effective new treatments and vaccines. \nThe LSIF remains committed to supporting APEC economies with fostering an enabling environment to grow their innovative life sciences sector during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The LSIF will work to update the LSIF Enablers of Investment Checklist to reflect the knowledge, lessons, and experiences learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolving requirements to attract investment in the sector. \nPromoting Resilient Trade in Medical Products \nResilient trade is necessary to ensure that people are able to access the medical products they need to combat pandemics. Many life science and medical technology companies have ramped up manufacturing capacity and output of essential medicines, research, and testing of potential vaccines, and diagnostic kits to meet the increase in demand. Collaboration between governments and industry remains vital to ensure the availability and accessibility of safe and effective medical products . \nThe LSIF acknowledges the importance of ensuring open, secure, stable, and efficient global supply chains and keeping markets open and trade flowing in response to COVID-19. We support APEC as a whole and members individually in reducing and eliminating unnecessary barriers to trade in medical products and in promoting resilient supply chains for medical products. We plan to present our recommendations for promoting resilient trade in medical products to the APEC Committee on Trade & Investment in 2020. \nEnsuring the Safety and Quality of Medical Products \nDuring this time of crisis, the LSIF is committed to further enhancing coordination of efforts to protect the medical product supply chain – and ultimately people and patients – by promoting trade in safe and quality drug products and ingredients. Protecting the integrity of the medical product supply chain is complex and requires a global approach. The APEC LSIF Supply Chain Security Toolkit for Medical Products is a comprehensive resource that addresses areas of vulnerability in the medical product supply chain and the lifecycle of medical products - from raw materials to use by patients. It contains recommended best practices and tools to prevent and detect substandard and falsified medical products before they reach people and patients. The toolkit also provides tools to efficiently and effectively respond to incidents involving substandard and falsified medical products. \nThe LSIF commits to continuing to work with APEC members and its network of APEC Training Centers of Excellence for Regulatory Science to ensure the wide dissemination of the Supply Chain Security Toolkit and to promote the adoption of best practices by industry stakeholders and regulators throughout the region. \nAccelerating Regulatory Convergence \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has called attention to the urgent need for streamlined market approval processes to enhance access and availability of new safe and effective medicines, including future COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. \nIn response to the pandemic, the LSIF is accelerating efforts to advance regulatory convergence - a voluntary process whereby the regulatory requirements across economies become more aligned over time as authorities adopt internationally recognized technical guidance, standards and scientific principles, and common or similar practices and procedures. Regulatory convergence helps APEC economies avoid unnecessary duplication of regulatory reviews thereby allowing products to be approved more quickly.  For instance, when multiple regulatory authorities accept the results of a multi-regional clinical trial or MRCT (clinical trials conducted in more than one region under a single protocol, designed to produce regulatory-grade data) then drug development is expedited.  With MRCTs there is no need to conduct individual clinical trials separately in each economy, unnecessarily putting additional trial participants at risk and extending the time it takes to get, in the case of COVID-19, a safe and effective vaccine or treatment to those who need them. \nRegulatory convergence related to post-approval changes can increase access by reducing strains on the supply chain that occur when multiple versions of a product need to be produced to comply with different domestic regulatory review criteria. Regulatory convergence can also save precious public resources by tapping into the expertise and work of other high-performing regulators around the region. Finally, regulatory convergence can reduce uncertainty and delays so companies find it easier to do business, investing their capital and creating jobs. \nThe LSIF reaffirms its commitment to advancing the convergence of the regulatory review and approval processes for safe and effective medical products, especially those essential to the COVID-19 response. We are currently updating and extending our strategic framework for accelerating regulatory convergence for medical products in the APEC region and commit to incorporating perspectives from the COVID-19 pandemic into our strategic framework. W e will continue to promote economic and technical cooperation, including capacity building, and provide needed assistance to developing economies . We commit to leveraging our network of 26 Centers of Excellence across 9 APEC economies, providing training programs for hundreds of regulators annually, to build the skilled human capacity needed to enable the region’s regulators, especially those in developing economies, to effectively and efficiently respond to COVID-19 and future pandemics. \nFacilitating Innovative Healthcare Financing \nThe economic case for increasing investment in health has never been stronger. Financial contributions from governments, civil society, and industry have proven vital in rapidly responding to the pandemic. Yet, sustainable healthcare financing is the long-term solution for establishing a baseline in health systems that enhances access to healthcare, which is especially important during public health crises. The work of the LSIF to increase access to healthcare by expanding the role of the business sector, improving health system efficiency, and exploring the use of innovative and alternative financing models will be more important than ever after the pandemic. \nThis year the LSIF will expand virtual cooperation to expand the use of the APEC Checklist of Enablers for Alternative Health Financing to help APEC economies improve their policy and regulatory environment for enabling the adoption and deployment of alternative financing mechanisms to help maintain and expand healthcare coverage. Health financing policies that strengthen health system resilience, health security, and expand universal health coverage will enable us respond to the current COVID-19 crisis as well as future challenges. \nHarnessing the D igital Economy and Digital Technology to Enable the Future of Life Sciences Innovation \nCOVID-19 has brought to the forefront the importance of leveraging the digital economy and digital technology tools, sharing information across borders between academia, governments, civil society, and the business sector in order to monitor, understand, mitigate, and respond to the pandemic. Thanks to economies sharing the genetic code of the virus that causes COVID-19 across the globe, scientists, public health officials and healthcare providers are able to accurately diagnose infections and pull expertise to develop safe and effective treatments and search for a vaccine. \nThe digital economy and digital technology tools have enabled healthcare services to be provided to a wider range of patients and the population at large than ever before and in ways that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. This has provided continuity of services to patients with ongoing medical needs that may not otherwise have been met in a time of social distancing or as many traditional health care facilities were dealing with challenges of the pandemic. Moving forward, digital health can be expanded to minimize unnecessary patient visits to secondary and tertiary hospitals to further optimize resources at these hospitals for patients with the greatest needs. \nThe LSIF commits to facilitating the sharing of information and best practices in harnessing the digital economy and digital technologies to enable the future of life sciences innovation and our ability to address COVID-19 and future health challenges. \n"},

However, the full potential of their contribution to the economy remains untapped. Moreover, women often take on informal work, such as caretaking and other domestic activities. \nAPEC member economies agreed to the La Serena Roadmap for Women and Inclusive Growth in 2019. The roadmap details directions and policy actions that will guide and drive members to increase women’s economic participation in the region that will lead to more inclusive economic growth. \nAdministered by the APEC Policy Partnership on Women and the Economy , the roadmap seeks to encourage actions in five cross-cutting areas affecting economic growth for women. \nDepending on each APEC member economy’s social, economic, political and legal circumstances, the roadmap puts forward four targets, including having laws, policies and regulations in place by 2030 that prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in employment access, opportunities and conditions. \nAnother target is increasing the region’s gender balance among science, technology, engineering and mathematics graduates in tertiary education, and in research and development positions. \n“Now APEC has concrete targets such as putting in place laws, policies and regulations that will provide equal access to capital and assets for both men and women and increase the region’s gender balance in leadership positions,” Dr Sta Maria applauded. \nMalaysia, as the host of APEC this year , will continue to advance women’s participation in the economy under its second priority of inclusive economic participation. \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \n"},

It is a necessity to survive,” he said in his opening remarks of the APEC 26 th Small and Medium Enterprises Ministerial Meeting held virtually on Friday. \nAPEC ministers in charge of small and medium enterprise policy exchanged views to address the severe economic impact of the pandemic to MSMEs and detailed steps to build more resilient, inclusive and sustainable environment for the sector. \nMSMEs play a significant role in the region’s economic growth, contributing around 40 to 60 percent to the growth domestic products of most APEC economies. As a response to the pandemic, APEC members have been providing support measures for the sector ranging from tax reliefs, wage subsidies, interest rates reduction, soft loans and refinancing, so that business owners and managers can sustain their operations and continue to contribute to the global economy. \n“In the new normal, businesses must pivot their strategies and business models to adapt to the digital economy and incorporate innovation and technology in order to remain resilient,” he added. “Besides all the fiscal stimulus, it is equally imperative to support MSMEs to go digital while helping them to adjust and overcome the challenges.” \nHe cautioned members of the multi-faceted challenges and concerns of going digital, including data privacy, cybersecurity, digital fraud and the digital divide. He highlighted the importance of strengthening cooperation and collaboration within APEC member economies “during and beyond this pandemic.” \nAPEC has been consistent in acknowledging the significant contribution MSMEs give to the region’s economy and employment. In her remarks at the meeting, Dr Rebecca Fatima Sta Maria, Executive Director of the APEC Secretariat, highlighted that policy work undertaken by other APEC groups can contribute to helping MSMEs in the region. \n“Support for MSMEs in APEC is cross-cutting and requires close partnership within our fora and the private sector,” she said. “We need to advance progress in structural reforms, trade facilitation and digital initiatives such as the single window implementation to make it easier, faster and cheaper to do business in the region and to ensure seamless flow of good and services within economies and across the borders.” \nDuring the meeting, ministers endorsed a joint statement focusing on member economies’ commitment to support MSMEs in restarting and reviving their businesses through digitalization, innovation and technology. \nMinisters also endorsed a new five-year vision to reinforce business ethics and integrity in health-related sectors called Vision 2025 launched earlier this month at the 2020 APEC Business Ethics for SMEs Virtual Forum under the world’s largest ethics pacts to strengthen ethical business practices in the medical device and biopharmaceutical sectors. \nTo read the 2020 APEC SME Ministerial Statement visit this page . \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

These measures include temporary export bans and quotas on food products such as rice, buckwheat, soybeans, wheat, maize, barley and eggs—all critical staples for families. \nWhile the number of export restrictions and bans in APEC does not seem to be high at this point, the policy brief highlights the importance for member economies to stay vigilant and intensify cooperation efforts to avoid any escalation of these types of measures. \n“The last thing we want to see in the current pandemic is a food crisis where the availability of food staples are scarce and prices are high,” acknowledged the APEC Secretariat’s Executive Director, Dr Rebecca Sta Maria. “APEC needs to ensure that the food supply chains remain open and available for all of our citizens, including vulnerable communities.” \nThe APEC region’s food security environment is in better shape today compared to the global food crisis of 2007–2008. APEC’s collective stock-to-use ratios for maize, rice and wheat has doubled since then. However, only less than one-third of APEC economies improved their rice and wheat ratios, and more than half of APEC economies currently have their maize stocks-to-use ratios at low levels, below 10 percent. \n“This reinforces the need to keep open trade policies as a tool to improve food stocks during this pandemic,” says Kuriyama. \nKuriyama says that strengthening food security requires collective efforts in addition to open trade policies, such as maintaining connectivity, improving resiliency of food supply chains, keeping transparency and reinforcing international cooperation, among others. \nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the policy brief acknowledges that food security is an important and complex area that requires further analysis. The APEC Policy Support Unit could work closely with relevant APEC groups to have a better understanding of the current challenges and support appropriate food security policy responses to COVID-19. \nDownload the Export Restrictions and Food Security in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic Policy Brief \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

The policy brief underlines a recent uptick of protective measures that are being implemented by some governments around the world as a reaction to secure stocks, such as export restrictions on medical supplies, equipment and protective gear. \n“It is important for APEC economies to consider initiatives to avoid the implementation of any unnecessary trade-restrictive measures to trade in medical goods, in particular regarding export bans and restrictions,” said Carlos Kuriyama, Senior Analyst at the Policy Support Unit. \nThe policy brief indicates that export restrictions on medical goods not only restrict access to those products, particularly to those economies without the facilities or with a limited capacity to produce any of these essential medical goods, but also they could increase prices and affect the production chain. \n“APEC can facilitate the flow of medical goods by lowering tariffs following the model used to reduce tariffs on environmental goods, and by considering a commitment to refrain from implementing unnecessary trade-restrictive measures affecting medical goods,” observed Kuriyama. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also triggered an increase of internal movement restriction orders and cross-border restrictions globally, disrupting supply lines and adding pressure to businesses and people’s livelihoods. \nGiven the importance of such products today, the policy brief also recommends APEC economies to work closely in keeping supply lines open for the provision of medical and other essential goods. \nDownload the policy brief, Promoting Trade in Medical Goods to Tackle COVID-19 Challenges \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

We would very much welcome creative innovation and ideas from youths and talent in the region.” \nThe region-wide coding competition, supported by APEC, the Asia Foundation, and Google, will be held virtually from 23 October to 2 November this year. Participating teams are challenged to build new mobile or web tools that can help small businesses in the tourism industry better navigate and respond to the varied impacts of COVID-19 on the sector. \n“The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on small and medium-sized businesses that support the tourism and hospitality industry across the APEC region,” said John Karr, Senior Director for Technology Programs at the Asia Foundation. “The 2020 APEC App Challenge will demonstrate how digital tools and services can help these businesses survive during this difficult time.” \nParticipants will have two weeks to complete their products, after which the top teams will demonstrate their apps to a panel of judges during a virtual pitch session. Winners will receive cash prizes and other exciting opportunities. Announcement of the winners will be made during the APEC Annual Ministerial Meeting this November. \nAs the 2020 host economy, one of the priorities of Malaysia is to promote and mainstream efforts across APEC to leverage digital technologies to achieve balanced, inclusive, sustainable, innovative and secure growth. Malaysia has recently recalibrated its theme this year to focus on building a resilient future. \n“Small businesses are integral to economic growth across APEC economies,” said Andrew Ure, Head of Public Affairs for Google Asia-Pacific. “This year’s challenge aims to help small businesses in the tourism sector learn the digital skills that will help them get back on their feet and grow.\" \nTo join the 2020 APEC App Challenge, interested developers should register their teams of two to six members by October 22. All team members must be citizens or residents of APEC member economies. \nFor more information and to register for the challenge, visit the webpage: www.apec.org/App-Challenge . \n### \nFor further details, or to arrange possible media interviews, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 or [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 or [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

It can be viewed at http://statistics.apec.org/ . \nImproving on its first release in 2010, the new StatsAPEC site now features a streamlined and modern design and functionality as well as newly updated data. The statistics portal offers the only consolidated source of APEC-specific data going back to APEC’s inception in 1989. \nData are updated twice a year, every June and December, and can be exported to third-party data processing software for further analysis. Officials, stakeholders, media, students and the public in general can have cost-free access to all the data found in StatsAPEC. \n“Our objective is to provide a go-to data source for researchers and policymakers who need information specific to the APEC region,” said Dr Denis Hew, Director of the APEC Policy Support Unit. “It is crucial to have wide access to data in the region to enrich the discussions in APEC and contribute to evidence-based policymaking.” \nStatsAPEC comprises two major components including the Key Indicator Database with more than 120 trade, financial and socio-economic indicators, and the Bilateral Linkages Database which facilitates detailed analysis of trade and investment flows within APEC and between APEC and the world. In addition, users can also access a broad range of indicators of APEC aggregate data, making it easier to examine the region as a whole. \nDr Hew explained that currently the Policy Support Unit collects publicly available macro-level data to populate the database, such as gross domestic product (GDP), trade or employment. \n“Looking ahead, we hope to complement the existing resources with additional data that provides insights into the conditions of micro, small and medium enterprises, women, workers and households in the APEC region,” he added. \nUsers also have access to the StatsAPEC Glossary to find all the indicators’ definitions used in the databases.
