Ministers recognized that the risk of this pandemic is far greater for women and vulnerable groups and urged economies to focus efforts on building resilience to be better prepared to respond to future pandemics and other shocks. \n“We need to have a sustainability mindset where we meet food security demands without compromising the well-being and ability of the future generation to fulfil their needs, as well as safeguarding natural resources,” he explained. He added that members need to address disruptions to employment and income sources. \nThe growing adoption of technology in the agriculture sector such as smart farming and biotechnology can enhance food security by increasing efficiency and productivity, bridging production and consumers’ demands, and minimizing food loss and waste. Members are encouraged to invest in training and capacity building to equip farmers and producers with necessary digital skills. \nMinisters endorsed a joint statement, highlighting their commitment to bolster food security resiliency and efforts to prevent future pandemics. \nTo read the 2020 Ministerial Policy Dialogue on Food Security Statement on COVID-19 visit this page \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

Open and non-discriminatory markets will ensure that goods and services can reach those in most urgent need”, she continued. Likewise, continued investment in the region will be important to countering the economic fallout from the pandemic. \n“We must intensify efforts to enhance the financial inclusion of MSMEs and their participation in international trade through a more robust enabling environment and capacity building for digital transformation”, Dato Rohana noted. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of a robust digital connectivity to promote economic participation and drive inclusive growth. APEC economies should foster the development of more secure, accessible and affordable digital infrastructure for all and of free and secure flows of data across borders. \nThere should also be a commitment to sharing research findings and vaccine solutions on a free and open basis. \nTrade needs to play a central role in economic recovery. “Now more than ever, we need to stay the course on trade and investment liberalization and not regress from free trade”, Dato Rohana stated. “We need to constantly remind ourselves that the pursuit of open markets in the region has lifted millions of people out of poverty and not turn our back on globalization.” \nAPEC economies must work collaboratively to plan for the re-opening of borders. ABAC proposes the establishment of a temporary APEC coordination body as soon as possible to provide guidance for the orderly re-opening of borders and development of quarantine protocols. This body would collaborate, share information and evaluate available data against agreed criteria, that would enable all APECeconomies to assess when and how to open borders and fully reconnect with other economies as safely as possible. \nThe full text of the ABAC COVID-19 Report may be viewed at: \nhttp://www2.abaconline.org/assets/ABAC_COVID-19_Report.pdf \nFor further information please contact: \nMr. Syazwan Zainal, ABAC Malaysia Centre, Tel: +60 12 261 9959, Email: [email protected] Mr. Antonio Basilio, Director, ABAC Secretariat, Tel: (63 2) 8845 4564, Email: [email protected] \n"},

Women may also be at greater risk or exposure due to occupational sex-segregation—according to a United Nations’ policy brief , women make up 70 percent of the health workforce and are more likely to be frontline health workers, especially as nurses, midwives and community health workers. \nDatuk Seri Rina highlighted the importance of APEC not only as a policy forum, but as a platform to advance regional joint actions towards providing equal access to resources and opportunities for women and girls to benefit from and contribute to redeveloping our economy. \n“It is critical for APEC economies to adjust our policies urgently to support, empower and effectively address the varying degrees of multidimensional and damaging impacts on women and girls in the region during this pandemic,” she added. \nRecognizing that more effort is needed, especially in the area of women’s participation in the digital economy, leadership and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), Datuk Seri Rina urged member economies to intensify public partnerships and engagement with the private sector. She stressed the role of the La Serena Roadmap on Women and Inclusive Growth as an important guide for members for achieving the women’s empowerment agenda. \nEndorsed in Chile, last year, the roadmap seeks to encourage actions in several cross -cutting areas affecting economic growth for women. This includes access to capital and markets, labor force participation, access to leadership positions, education, training and skills development. The roadmap also encourages promoting more access for women in the context of a constantly changing world of work, as well as advancing sex-disaggregated data collection and analysis. \n“Women workers and women-led small businesses continue to bear the brunt of the negative side effects of travel restrictions, lockdowns and social distancing regimes because women are in consumer-facing services sectors,” explained APEC Secretariat Executive Director, Dr Rebecca Sta Maria in her remarks at the forum. “It is in this context that APEC’s continued leadership is necessary. We need to focus on not just the challenges but also on the role that women are playing in dealing with the pandemic, their contributions and their role in the recovery.” \nDr Sta Maria underlined the significance of trade in promoting gender equality and the need for member economies to focus on inclusive trade and investment policies so that “the policies facilitate unlocking otherwise untapped potential of women and girls in the region.” \nGender and economic development ministers and senior officials agreed on a joint statement at the meeting, reflecting their views to advancing women’s economic empowerment to strengthen post-pandemic economic recovery and resilience. \nRead the APEC Women and the Economy Forum Statement \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

He reinforced that the task will involve close participation not only between APEC economies, but with different sectors, such as the private sector. \nThis is the second virtual gathering of APEC senior officials this year, and is part of a cluster of virtual engagements among APEC groups and committees that are responsible for different sectors, such as disaster response and trade and investment. Each of these groups are exploring solutions in response to the pandemic from different angles. \n“The innovative and dynamic nature of the Asia-Pacific business community will be crucial in laying the groundwork for the region’s economic recovery and resilience,” he said. “The recommendations of this sector, as represented by the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) , will be relevant additions to the recommendations we will be presenting to our ministers.” \nReporting on the recommendation of the business sector, the 2020 Chair ABAC, Dato’ Rohana Mahmood, reiterates the importance of keeping markets, goods, services and investment open. “A global pandemic requires a coordinated global response,” she noted. “In a deeply integrated and interconnected world, it does not make sense for any economy to seek to be self-sufficient in the essential tools to fight the pandemic.” \n“At this point during the crisis, multilateral coordination is more crucial than ever,” said Dr Rebecca Sta Maria , Executive Director of the APEC Secretariat. “We are entering a period when decisions are to be made that will affect how economies will engage with each other to face challenges not only in the months ahead, but for years to come.” \nHairil noted that everything APEC will do from this point on will be framed by the COVID-19 crisis. But he added that many of the agendas and priorities the forum has been pursuing for the past few years leading to 2020 seem to have only gotten more relevant, such as adapting to digital technologies while ensuring economies are people-centered. \n“We have been shown why it is so important to ensure that our economies have the ability to cushion even the poorest citizens and smallest businesses from economic fallout,” said Hairil. “The continuation of trade and cooperation can be a matter of survival as well as a means to achieving shared prosperity.” \nAPEC’s Ministers Responsible for Trade will hold a virtual meeting on Saturday, 25 July 2020, to follow up on recommendations and work plans submitted by senior officials and ABAC. \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

It identifies the economic issues affecting food security and puts forward policy recommendations to strengthen regional food security. \nThe report notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions to the production of several food products, particularly those that require intensive use of labour, such as meat processing facilities and fruit and vegetable packing plants. Outbreaks among food production workers and the unavailability of temporary migrant workers could impact the economy’s ability to produce food. \n“Member economies need to ensure that reductions in production capacity do not occur in multiple food sectors at the same time, which could potentially cause a breakdown in the overall domestic and international food supply chain,” explained Carlos Kuriyama, Senior Analyst with the APEC Policy Support Unit . \nMost food products are shipped by sea. Although most of the major seaports in the region have remained open and shipping lines have continued to operate the analysis shows that there have been substantial delays in shipping times for sea freight due to reduced container capacity as well as stringent border measures to reduce the spread of the virus. \nTo tackle distribution bottlenecks, the report recommends that APEC member economies establish clear guidelines at ports of entry concerning the mobility of shipping crews and other transport workers, as well as expediting customs clearance. Policymakers are also encouraged to accelerate wider applications of digital technology at the border. \nAccelerating the adoption of digital tools will also help address the notable shift in consumer patterns of food products. For example, many restaurants have been forced to close. But others are offering delivery service to bring food directly to customers through digital platforms. The report highlights the case of small-scale farmers and fishermen in the region who have taken a similar approach and turned to e-commerce and mobile money for the first time in order to connect with buyers and suppliers. \nThe report further recommends APEC economies to consider food trade as an essential component of food security and to avoid protectionist measures such as export restrictions and policies which are not based on evidence and scientific risk assessment. \nSenior agriculture and food industry officials as well as private sector representatives will convene virtually later this week to further discuss strategic measures to address the challenges caused by the COVID-19 crisis and improve resiliency in food systems. Following the meeting, agriculture and food ministers and senior representatives will also meet virtually at the Ministerial Policy Dialogue on Food Security on 27 October, chaired by Malaysia’s Minister of Agriculture and Food Industries, Datuk Seri Dr Ronald Kiandee. \nFor more information on the “Food Security Response Measures to COVID-19” Policy Brief by APEC Policy Support Unit, visit this page . \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

However, it is also preventable with effective vaccination and secondary prevention approaches, including screening. Early detection and management is key to successful cervical cancer treatment. \n“APEC economies face challenges in availability, accessibility and affordability to cervical cancer screening, disproportionately affecting low-income women at high risk,” explained Dr Fanghui Zhao, Director of the Department of Cancer Epidemiology, National Cancer Center and Cancer Hospital with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the author of the winning study. \n“Cervical cancer remains one of the gravest avoidable medical threats to women’s lives,” she added. “Developing and validating affordable and easy-to-access technologies and strategies are the key solution. By applying effective preventative methods, no woman should die from cervical cancer.” \nDr Zhao was announced the winner during the virtual High Level Policy Dialogue on Women and the Economy meeting on Wednesday by Malaysia’s Minister of Women, Family and Community Development, Datuk Seri Rina Harun. APEC gender and economic development ministers, senior officials, as well as thought leaders and experts have recognized the differing socioeconomic impact of the pandemic at the meeting and committed to put women and girls at the center of economic recovery efforts . \n“COVID-19 has demonstrated the importance of caregiving and the disproportionate role that women play in providing it. It is incumbent upon policymakers to identify data-backed policies that alleviate the double burden women currently face, because we all benefit when women participate in the economy,” said Minister Datuk Seri Rina Harun. \nLaunched in Chile last year, the APEC Healthy Women, Healthy Economies Research Prize awards USD 20,000 to the winner and USD 2,000 each to two runners-up. In partnership with Merck, the prize recognizes of the winners’ work which enables policymakers and business leaders to identify and implement measures to improve women’s health in APEC economies so women can join and rise in the workforce. \n“In times of uncertainty, data is particularly crucial to ensure that policymakers and business leaders are able to make informed decisions. The collection, collation, and proliferation of sex-disaggregated data and research is vital to ensure that women are not left behind in the recovery from COVID-19,” said Liz Henderson, Regional Vice President, Asia Pacific, Merck Healthcare. “Better health and economic outcomes for women will improve not only gender parity, but also the overall economic environment.” \nDr Lih Rong Wang of Chinese Taipei and Dr Dorothy Chan of Hong Kong, China were the runners up for this year’s prize. Dr Wang’s research explored the positive impact of family-oriented work policies like flexible work schedules and paid parental leave. Dr. Chan’s research studied how the efficacy of health programs can be improved by involving stakeholders who can incorporate cultural and socio-environmental components in future interventions. \nThe Healthy Women, Healthy Economies initiative aims to improve women’s health and economic empowerment through public-private partnerships. Released in 2015, the Healthy Women, Healthy Economies Policy Toolkit highlights five areas for improving women’s health across five areas: workplace health and safety; health awareness and access; sexual and reproductive health; gender-based violence; and work/life balance. \nFor more information on the work of the finalists and on applying for the 2021 prize, please visit the APEC Healthy Women Healthy Economies website . \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .

The global community was just coming to terms with the potential effects of COVID-19’s spread when activities among officials from around the Asia-Pacific region began on 3 February 2020 here in Putrajaya. \nAPEC working groups and committees still met, however, to discuss work plans and agendas to be advanced in 2020, a red-letter year for APEC . The meetings covered many topics, such as trade and investment , structural reform , business mobility , sustainable development , and corruption . \nAmong the groups that met was the APEC Health Working Group, which traces its origins to the multilateral response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak 18 years ago, and whose continued activity has just become a regional first priority. \nAccording to the Chair of APEC Senior Officials, Mr Hairil Yahri Yaacob, the fact that APEC members came together despite the health scare proved the solidarity and resilience of the region, and was an example of how economies can rise together to shared challenges. \n“I would like to express our appreciation to APEC member economies that put their faith in Malaysia’s leadership and made it a point to participate in the meetings,” said Mr Yaacob, during his opening remarks opening the First Senior Officials Meeting of APEC 2020. \nHe emphasised that the well-being of the people was given utmost priority and various safety and precautionary measures were put in place to ensure these gatherings went smoothly. \nHe noted that Malaysia, as host, even took advantage of advancements in technology to make remote participation through videoconferencing a seamless experience. This enabled members who could not travel due to health-related domestic issues to participate remotely from various cities in other economies. \n“Throughout these 17 days, we saw participation from various stakeholders in meetings, workshops, activities and side events,” Yaacob said. “We also saw strong collaboration between the public and private sectors especially during policy dialogues.” \n“This was something that Malaysia did not anticipate but we managed to put in place necessary measures to mitigate the situation,” Yaacob said. “In managing the risks and threats of this virus, the APEC 2020 Secretariat worked very closely with the Ministry of Health Malaysia and other relevant authorities to ensure the safety of delegates and all parties involved in the meetings.” \nAPEC Senior Officials \nFor more: \nThe complete list of meetings held in Putrajaya can be viewed here . \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9137 3886 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \n"},

This has improved the business climate and increased economic opportunities,” explained Dr James Ding, Chair of the APEC Economic Committee. “The pandemic has pushed policymakers around the region to further speed up this effort to support the economic recovery and make it easier for people and businesses to get back on their feet.” \nThe APEC region’s economic growth is now expected to decline by 3.7 percent in 2020, bringing the total output loss to a staggering USD 2.9 trillion. Member economies have been quick to roll out significant and targeted fiscal measures ranging from 1 percent to 20 percent of gross domestic product to address the impact of COVID-19. Despite this unprecedented stimulus in response to economic losses, the crisis persists. \n“With more businesses facing the threat of permanent closure, unemployment numbers rising and health risks still high, we need to quickly improve our current policies and regulations, especially those related to healthcare systems, social protection, the ease of doing business and inclusive growth,” Dr Ding added. \nAdvancing the digital economy to empower businesses and communities in these difficult times has been the focus across the region. In a virtual meeting last week, experts shared how they are facilitating work in the digital economy, including by addressing issues around competition infringement and competition law, and strengthening economic and legal infrastructure and regulatory reform. \n“In the past few months, we have experienced the importance of connectivity and now fully appreciate why it is so critical for a successful digital economy. We need to ensure that when we advance the digital economy agenda, we also build capacity, infrastructure and narrow the digital divide,” said Dr Rebecca Sta Maria, Executive Director of the APEC Secretariat. “This way, we can encourage the inclusive participation of all members of the society in our economy, including those who are vulnerable.” \nMembers also reviewed what progress has been made toward promoting more open, well-functioning transparent and competitive markets and deepening participation by all segments of society and sustainable social policies. \n“This pandemic has presented an opportunity to develop a long-term reform agenda that will improve members’ resiliency towards any emergencies in the future,” Dr Ding concluded. \nUnder the Renewed APEC Agenda for Structural Reform mandate, member economies have been working toward a robust, comprehensive and ambitious agenda to reduce inequality and stimulate growth since 2015. This mandate expires at the end of 2020. Members are currently reviewing the final report of progress and planning for the next structural reform agenda beyond 2020. \n# # # \nFor further details, please contact: \nMasyitha Baziad +65 9751 2146 at [email protected] Michael Chapnick +65 9647 4847 at [email protected] \nMore on APEC meetings, events, projects and publications can be found on www.apec.org .
